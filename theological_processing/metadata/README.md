# Source Metadata

This directory contains YAML metadata files for each processed source.

## Metadata Files

Each source gets a metadata file named: `{SOURCE_ID}_metadata.yaml`

Example: `ORTHODOXY_CHEST_metadata.yaml`

## Metadata Structure

The metadata follows the Theological Source Metadata Schema and includes:
- Core identification (title, author, publication year)
- Source classification (genre, theological tradition)
- Content characteristics (length, structure)
- Theological coverage (topics, concepts)

## Usage

Metadata files are automatically generated during the chunking stage and used throughout the pipeline for consistent source identification and classification.
