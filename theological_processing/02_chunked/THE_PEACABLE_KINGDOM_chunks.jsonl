And if ethicists are too busy building coherent systems to do so, at least Christian ethicists will respect our need for “concrete guidance in making and justifying a decision.” 1 Yet Stanley Hauerwas eschews such a responsibility from the outset. Or does he? Is it rather that the one who puts me through rigorous paces, helping me to think out my life as a Christian in our fragmented and violent world—that such a one is training me, as well as anyone can, to take the small steps which will cumulate in large decisions? And if that’s not the way it works, it won’t work at all, for decisions are not so much the sorts of things we do (or make) as they are more nearly made for us, yet in the end make us by shaping our subsequent lives. So Hauerwas has long challenged our propensity to link ethics with “difficult decisions.” Instead, he reminds us, what we can do is to help create a context more conducive to our deciding one way than another. Church promises to be that context: the social institution seeking to embody a specific configuration of virtues in its members. Christian ethicists can say what that configuration ought to look like and why. So their arguments will direct us to the sort of lives to which we would aspire, and the work that ought characteristically be ours. In this roundabout yet organic way, then, these ethicists will most certainly have helped us decide what to do—with our lives.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 0, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.043910"}

And it is, I shall argue, a thoroughly Catholic argument, in that sense which transcends “Roman” and increasingly includes Protestants who would participate in a long-standing tradition. For it locates the self firmly within a community, shaped in its freedom by the language and practices of that community, learning how to follow Jesus by continued schooling in that community’s response. Moreover, it traces that response as the bishops first of South and now of North America have indicated: to Jerusalem, where Jesus confronts the powers of this world. It is a world comprised of those, including ourselves, who have chosen not to make this story of God their story. So the primary task of those who would make Jesus’ story theirs is to stand within that world—their world—witnessing to a peaceable Kingdom which reflects the right understanding of that very world. Such a stance will make stringent demands on those who would so follow Jesus. Much as Gandhi saw that a policy of satyagraha would require communities whose way of life would comprise training in nonviolent resistance, so Hauerwas argues for a church which could form its members in the virtues of patience and hope, as well as the capacity rightly to discriminate in particular situations.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 1, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.043913"}

Patience, with hope, will indeed be the virtues needed to grow up into the reality of a community witnessing to the peaceable kingdom. And here Hauerwas carries our appreciation of the virtues some steps further than his earlier writings. He makes explicit here how these are developed in relation with other persons. The peace that we can know, with ourselves, is the fruit of forgiving others, and forgiving others requires a context of truthfulness which assists us in shedding our illusions. Since that description could hardly characterize the world in which we live, it must depict the community we would form in the likeness of the kingdom Jesus preached and embodied.

In the process of spelling out a critique of contemporary philosophical and theological ethics, an undergraduate asked one of those simple questions that startle one into self-recognition, namely, what difference did my position make for how I taught my courses in Christian ethics? Much to my embarrassment, I had to admit that it did not make much difference, as I spent most of the time in my courses teaching other people’s views. No doubt that has much to do with the ethos drummed into me from graduate school that my first responsibility was to present all sides of a question in the interest of scholarly fairness and objectivity. Yet that valid concern and task can too easily become a formula for intellectual cowardice and self-deception if it results in the assumption that as teachers we are released from the necessity of exposing our views to the critical response of students. So I returned home resolved to plan and teach a course shaped by my constructive proposals about how Christian ethics should be understood. This book is the result of that resolve.

As a result, I hope this primer bears the mark of actually having been taught and so will be more accessible for classroom use. “Primers” or “introductions,” of course, are notoriously hard to write. They are usually written either by younger scholars who think they know much more than is needed for such a trivial task, or by scholars toward the end of their careers who know they will never know enough but have gained the clarity to write with the simplicity and confidence that comes from knowing what they do not know. That I have attempted this “introduction” in mid-career probably indicates how little I have yet understood about Christian ethics. I have presumed to make the attempt simply because I am convinced Christian ethics is never the kind of reflection in which you ever “get it all straight,” yet it is important that we try as best we can to introduce it to others.

Hicks rightly saw the ark as an eschatological sign of peace, since only if the wolf was still able to lie down with the lamb would a saving remnant be possible. In this time when we are threatened by a flood of fire, I suspect we badly need Hicks’s inspired vision. I hope this book may in some small way help engender and sustain such a vision.

Nor will I offer any extensive analysis of past and current figures in Christian ethics. Instead this book is an introduction in the sense that it attempts to present one straightforward account of a Christian ethic.

For it is my hope that the mode of analysis I present does justice to the shape of Christian convictions as they are found in Scripture, tradition, and the continuing lives of those who seek to live in a manner faithful to God’s kingdom. Because most of my previous work is in essay form many have suggested I need to “pull it all together” in one book. In some ways such a suggestion, while perfectly legitimate, is a bad idea. Not only do I have no idea of how I can “pull it all together,” but more importantly, I would still maintain that an attempt at a summary distorts my basic understanding of theology.

Indeed, nonviolence is not just one implication among others that can be drawn from our Christian beliefs; it is at the very heart of our understanding of God.

The reader will find this work to be as much about theology as about ethics. One of its major concerns is to show why Christian ethics is a mode of theology. Indeed, to begin by asking what is the relation between theology and ethics is to have already made a mistake. Christian convictions are by nature meant to form and illumine lives. Since I hold that ethics is theology, in this book I sometimes treat issues, such as the authority of Scripture or the relation of reason and revelation, that are generally reserved for systematic or philosophical theology.

Collingwood’s analysis of historical investigation and construction, and correlatively of human action, and as a result was sure any account of Jesus’ life and its relation to our own involved questions of historical explanation and human activity.

Nonetheless, he had his hand on the right problems. Given this, it puzzled me that the Niebuhr of The Meaning of Revelation could write Radical Monotheism and Western Culture , since the God of the latter seemed to lack the characteristics necessary to be identified with a particular people and their distinct history. Perhaps the tension between the positions of those two books witnessed to the tension in Niebuhr’s life between the particular and universal, the historical and transcendent, the church as sect and as universal. While at present I wish to challenge the either/or implied by these polarities, I was convinced then that these were the alternatives. And if I were forced to choose between the two sides of Niebuhr’s thought, I would take my stand on the side of particularity. Otherwise, I simply did not see how one could make sense of the significance of the life and death of Jesus for Christian life and thought. That is not to say that I wished to continue to do “Christology” in terms of classical categories. Under the tutelage of Hans Frei, and continuing to read Barth, I came increasingly to appreciate how the more “orthodox” Christologies failed to do justice to the scriptural portrayal of Jesus.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 21, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.046744"}

Wittgenstein’s influence was of quite a different order than H. Richard Niebuhr’s. He slowly cured me of the notion that philosophy was primarily a matter of positions, ideas, and/or theories. From Wittgenstein, and later David Burrell, I learned to understand and also to do philosophy in a therapeutic mode. But there were also substantive matters to be learned from Wittgenstein. Originally sparked by my interest in history, I had begun to work on issues in the philosophy of mind such as the relation of “mind-body problem,” “intentionality,” and “motivation.” Wittgenstein (and Ryle and Austin) helped me see that “mind” did not relate to body as a cause to effect, for “mind” was not a singular thing or function. Moreover, Wittgenstein ended forever any attempt on my part to try to anchor theology in some general account of “human experience,” for his writings taught me that the object of the theologians’ work was best located in terms of the grammar of the language used by believers. Because of these theological and philosophical interests I was struck by James Gustafson’s suggestion that theological ethics might best focus on character and the virtues for displaying the nature of Christian moral existence.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 22, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.046745"}

It occurred to me that the correlation between our knowledge of God and of self, a correlation so well displayed by Calvin, might best be expressed in terms of character and the virtues. Armed with this hunch I began a serious study of Aristotle and Aquinas. Contrary to the stereotypes, I found them remarkably congenial thinkers who assisted me in making many of the philosophical and theological moves I needed to develop my theological agenda. Interestingly, I did not find Aquinas to be first and foremost a “natural law ethicist,” but one who saw how the theological virtues could help us understand and shape our lives. Moreover I was increasingly convinced that unless Aristotle’s and Aquinas’s approach to ethics was recovered there was no way to break the impasse, and largely distracting debate, occasioned by Joseph Fletcher’s, Situation Ethics.

However the analysis of character I provided there was far too formal and abstract. Emphasis on character and the virtues countered the theological and ethical occasionalism so prevalent in theology and ethics, but the material content of character remained largely underdeveloped. While in Character and the Christian Life I used the theme of sanctification to spell out the nature of Christian character more concretely, I was still largely depending on secondary theological notions rather than displaying how more basic Christian convictions make, or should make, a difference.

Indeed it would be fascinating to study why so many of us who become “ethicists” work to transform that task from advocacy to parasitic theological analysis. Two things soon suggested to me that being an “ethicist” involved more than being an expositor of the logical and behavioral implications of religious discourse. First, I began my teaching career at the height of the Vietnam War, and, second, I began to read the novels and philosophy of Iris Murdoch. Murdoch’s powerful critique of contemporary philosophy’s pretensions to objectivity in the name of analysis seemed to me decisive. Moreover, her emphasis on vision as the hallmark of the moral life struck me as exactly what was missing from most accounts of the virtues. While I had some difficulty with Murdoch’s account of how we come to see, in particular her Platonic tendency to treat language as always distorting truthful vision, she nonetheless helped me understand how the virtues teach us to see the world without illusions or false hopes.

As a result I became increasingly aware of the insufficiency of Niebuhr’s realism to the degree that it implicitly legitimated pluralism and balance of power as the norms of a good polity. Attacks on the “bias of pluralism” by such people as Robert Paul Wolff and Ted Lowi applied as much to Niebuhr as to the political scientist, but those critiques led me to see a more profound issue. The question I put to Niebuhr did not simply concern the status of certain theories of pluralist democracies, but the very status of liberalism as the primary public philosophy of America.

Drawing on the theme of justification, Niebuhr provided little place for the possibility of growth in the Christian life. What Niebuhr lacked, and what growth in character and virtue demanded, was a corresponding community of character and virtue. Gradually I saw that my attempt to develop an ethic of virtue might have sectarian implications I had not anticipated. At that time I moved to the University of Notre Dame. There for the first time I encountered and began to take seriously the work of John Howard Yoder, who was then teaching at the Mennonite Seminary in Elkhart, Indiana and who now is at Notre Dame. The more I read of Yoder’s scattered essays, the more I began to think he represented a fundamental challenge to the way I had been taught to think of “social ethics.” Surprisingly, Yoder’s account of the church fit almost exactly the kind of community I was beginning to think was required by an ethics of virtue.

I had perhaps discovered a way, for example, to appreciate without piously distorting Mark’s powerful development of discipleship, which takes Jesus’ life to be a paradigm for our own lives.

ETHICS AND THE DEMAND FOR ABSOLUTES All ethical reflection occurs relative to a particular time and place. Not only do ethical problems change from one time to the next, but the very nature and structure of ethics is determined by the particularities of a community’s history and convictions. From this perspective the notion of “ethics” is misleading, since it seems to suggest that “ethics” is an identifiable discipline that is constant across history. In fact, much of the burden of this book will be to suggest that ethics always requires an adjective or qualifier—such as, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, existentialist, pragmatic, utilitarian, humanist, medieval, modern—in order to denote the social and historical character of ethics as a discipline. 1 This is not to suggest that ethics does not address an identifiable set of relatively constant questions—the nature of the good or right, freedom and the nature of human behavior, the place and status of rules and virtues—but any response to these questions necessarily draws on the particular convictions of historic communities to whom such questions may have significantly different meanings. That ethics is an activity relative to particular times, places, and communities may seem obvious, but it is also easily forgotten and its significance ignored.

We can be sure of our principles if they can be shown to rely upon God’s will. Because of this, some have claimed that if God does not exist everything is morally permissible. Though such a claim belies the complexity of the relation of religious convictions to morality, many believers and unbelievers alike seem to think that if God does not in some manner underwrite the absoluteness of our moral system we will not be able to say what is wrong with murder, or lying, or stealing, etc. As a Christian ethicist I am often asked “Aren’t there any absolutes anymore?” The questioners tend to assume that if the answer is “no,” then ethics has simply ceased to exist. They assume this even though it is by no means clear to what their term “absolute” applies—to values, or rules, or convictions—or even if such absolutes have anything to do with Christian beliefs and practices.

Indeed, one of the hallmarks of modernity is that we feel ourselves at once both determined and free. Peter Berger suggests an explanation for this glaring incompatibility in his Heretical Imperative. 6 According to Berger, premodern people lived for the most part in a given world. They had little choice about where to live, what vocation to enter, or whom to marry. As a result, they were not hounded by our modern ambivalence. While premodern people may have struggled with the meaning of life, they did not need to question, as we seem required to do, whether their life was sufficiently coherent to legitimately ask its meaning. Modern people, Berger contends, find themselves confronted not only by many possible courses of action, but also by many possible ways of thinking about the world. As a result all life has become consumer oriented. We choose not only between toothpastes, but between the very “plausibility” structures that give our lives coherence and meaning. Our need to choose even those basic beliefs about why things are as they are and not otherwise, suggests an arbitrariness about them which undermines truthfulness.

Or again modernity creates a new situation in which picking and choosing becomes an imperative.” 7 Thus our ethical theorizing has led to the notion that freedom is not only a necessity but a moral ideal. Freedom itself is at once the necessary and sufficient condition of being moral. But is this situation so unique? Haven’t almost all moral theories held in different ways that people could only be responsible for what they have the power to do? Has not freedom always been thought crucial to moral behavior? Yet for philosophers such as Aristotle, freedom was not an end in itself ; we became free only as we acquired the moral capability to guide our lives. To lack such capability was to be subject to the undisciplined desires and choices of the immature. Thus freedom did not reside in making choices but in being the kind of person for whom certain options simply were not open. For example, the courageous could not know the fears of the coward though they were required to know the fears appropriate to being courageous.

In contrast, the modern conception has made freedom the content of the moral life itself. It matters not what we desire, but that we desire. Our task is to become free, not through the acquisition of virtue, but by preventing ourselves from being determined, so that we can always keep our “options open.” We have thus become the bureaucrats of our own history, seeking never to be held responsible for any decisions, even for those we ourselves have made.

Anyone and everyone can thus be a moral agent, since it is in the self and not in social roles or practices that moral agency has to be located. 9 Thus it has become the task of ethical theory to find a foundation free of historical contingencies that can guarantee the availability of such freedom for the agent. The grand example of this project is, of course, the work of Immanuel Kant, who sought to ground morality in the very necessity of freedom.

Thus for Kant the autonomy of reason and the autonomy of morality rested on the same basis.

His first formulation of the categorical imperative was “Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law.” 10 While this principle, and its relation to Kant’s other formulations of the law, has been variously interpreted and restated, it is generally accepted as the basic statement for justifying moral judgments, whether it is called the “principle of generalization” or, more existentially, “the moral point of view.” The force of the principle stays the same: It renders the contingent history of the agent irrelevant in moral judgment and evaluation; it demands that the justification for our decisions be given from the perspective of anyone.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 53, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.051303"}

Finally, the absolutist strategy misconstrues the meaning and the task of Christian ethics. The task of Christian ethics is to help us see how our convictions are in themselves a morality. We do not first believe certain things about God, Jesus, and the church, and subsequently derive ethical implications from these beliefs. Rather our convictions embody our morality; our beliefs are our actions.

It schools us to assume we can, and perhaps always should, respond to any purported immoral action with “Who am I to say that is wrong?” As Bernard Williams points out, both the subjectivist and nonsubjectivist have no adequate justification for a response insofar as it is itself a moral thought. In mid air “it tries to stand outside all moral positions (including the thinker’s own) and yet still be a moral thought. But this midair place, by subjectivism itself, is not a place in which anyone can have a moral thought” because it forces us to assume a stance external to our commitments and cares, which are the lifeblood of any morality. 2 Such an account of objectivity has the peculiar effect of alienating the moral agent from his or her projects.

Williams does not think those who wish to assume a “midair” stance are properly able to argue the question “Why should I be moral?” Ethics does not begin (nor is it required to begin) with an attempt to answer that question. A disciplined set of analytic skills, ethics begins with the recognition that we are already in the moral adventure. We are able to proceed, not because we share a common rationality, but because we find ourselves to be people who care about something. 3 That we care is enough to ensure intelligible conversation with anyone who thinks he or she can opt out of moral involvement. From such a perspective the consistent amoralist does not make a rational mistake but a human mistake. As Williams points out, however, it is very difficult for the amoralist to be consistent.

Not all societies emphasize rules to the extent ours does.

In order to properly understand the significance of rules for our conduct, I must provide a brief analysis of the many kinds and functions of rules. Our relatively recent fascination with rules draws on the promise they seem to hold for the impersonal justification of our moral behavior. Rules give the appearance of ensuring the objectivity we otherwise find lacking in our individual decisions and judgments.

Some rules restrict, others regulate, and still others grant permission. We view them differently if enacted by a legislative body or by custom (which changes); still others seem to be so inherent in everyday practices we never think of them as rules. Further, their scope differs. Some, we believe, apply to all (these are not necessarily the most general), while others apply only to those performing certain functions. 5 Plato and Aristotle considered rules to be secondary to the virtues, which served to direct us to their true end, the human good. In our own day, however, questions concerning our ultimate end (“telos”), or what characterizes “the good life” have been dismissed because they are not subject to rational argument. 6 Rules in our society, therefore, are not derived from some fundamental conception of the human good.

In contrast, John Stuart Mill and the utilitarians argue that moral rules are but generalizations of our experience of what best serves to promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. In spite of the significant differences between these positions, they share the common assumption that ethics, first and foremost, should embody an adequate theory of moral obligation derived from, or involving in a fundamental manner, rules and principles. 7 They differ only about what single principle best supports and orders our rule-determined obligations. It has thus seemed to many philosophers that the fundamental task of ethics, given the confusion of our age, is to develop a theory sufficient to account for our primary moral obligations. A theory is needed, it seems, because it is assumed that convention, in and of itself, cannot be sufficient to determine which of our moral principles and rules are objective and nonarbitrary.

Thus the teleologists generally feel we ought to keep our promises because by doing so more good than evil obtains.

Utilitarianism perhaps presents the clearest example of this because of the simplicity of the formula “the greatest good for the greatest number,” but deontological systems often seek a similar overriding principle.

In contrast, an emphasis on rule-determined obligations abstracted from this story makes our existence appear to be only “one damn thing after another.” We should not be surprised, then, if the kind of convictions Christians hold are better exhibited by an analysis of the virtues.

If a human life is understood as a progress through harms and dangers, moral and physical, which someone may encounter and overcome in better and worse ways and with a greater or lesser measure of success, the virtues will find their place as those qualities the possession and exercise of which generally tend to success in this enterprise and the vices likewise as qualities which likewise tend to failure.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 80, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.055028"}

Some may think that emphasis on narrative as the primary grammar of Christian belief is a theological mistake. Surely we can talk about God in a more fundamental manner than through stories—e.g., through doctrine. Doctrinally we affirm that God is our creator and/or redeemer, or that God’s essential nature is that of a trinitarian relationship. But such emphasis ignores the fact that such “doctrines” are themselves a story, or perhaps better, the outline of the story. 15 Claims such as “God is creator” are simply shorthand ways of reminding us that we believe we are participants in a much more elaborate story, of which God is the author. Doctrines, therefore, are not the upshot of the stories; they are not the meaning or heart of the stories. Rather they are tools (sometimes even misleading tools), meant to help us tell the story better.

On analysis each appears a strange “object,” since it seems that our knowledge of one is dependent on the other. To “know” God requires a rethinking of what and how we know the self and the world. To know one’s self, one cannot but make claims about the kind of world in which selves are able to exist. Neither God, the world, nor the self are properly known as separate entities but are in a relation requiring concrete display. That display takes the form of a narrative in which we discover that the only way to “know” God, the world, or the self is through their history. Narrative plays a larger part in our lives than we often imagine. For example, we frequently introduce ourselves through narrative. To be sure, any story with which we identify “ourselves” can be and should be constantly tested by the history we have lived.

This, of course, follows from the basic theological claim that knowledge of God and knowledge of the self are interdependent. But once the formal nature of this claim is fleshed out in terms of narrative, we see its implications for the Christian life. Not only is knowledge of self tied to knowledge of God, but we know ourselves truthfully only when we know ourselves in relation to God. We know who we are only when we can place our selves—locate our stories—within God’s story. This is the basis for the extraordinary Christian claim that we participate morally in God’s life. For our God is a God who wills to include us within his life. This is what we mean when we say, in shorthand as it were, that God is a God of grace.

It is a gift that God wills to have our lives contribute to the eschatological purposes for creation. As creatures we cannot hope to return to God a gift of such magnitude. But we can respond with a willingness to receive. To learn to be God’s creature, to accept the gift, is to learn to be at home in God’s world. Just as we seek to make a guest feel “at home” in our home, so God seeks to have us feel “at home” by providing us with the opportunity to appropriate the gift in the terms it was given—that is, gratuitously. 16 The impossibility of reciprocity for God’s gift is not without analogies in our common experience. We cannot return our parent’s love except as we receive it and love others similarly. Also each of us are recipients of favors strewn through our lives.

Christians and Jews are traditioned people who believe that they have been invited to share a particular history that reflects the God who has brought us into being. To know our creator, therefore, we are required to learn through God’s particular dealings with Israel and Jesus, and through God’s continuing faithfulness to the Jews and the ingathering of a people to the church. Such knowledge requires constant appropriation, constant willingness to accept the gift of God’s good creation. As Christians we maintain that such appropriation is accomplished in and through our faithfulness to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. We believe that by learning to be his disciples we will learn to find our life—our story—in God’s story.

This empirical observation is not merely an interesting one; this notion of the essential nature of narrative as the form of God’s salvation is why we rightly attribute to Scripture the truth necessary for our salvation. 20 Of course, we cannot be brought to understanding without training, for we resist at least the part of the narrative which describes us as sinful creatures. We can only know God by having our lives transformed through initiation into the kingdom. Such a transformation requires that we see the world as it is, not as we want it to be—that is, as sinful and ourselves as sinners.

We always feel that if we had just known more at the time we would have made a better decision and been less determined. This feeling often leads to what I regard as the most basic modern deception, namely that to be free means not to be held to those “decisions” I made in the past which were less than fully mine. One of the assumptions behind this view of freedom is the idea that the greater our awareness, the greater our freedom. Thus, the more I understand my situation, the more I know about the long-term effects of my decision, the more likely it is that I will make a free and non-determined decision that I can gladly claim as “mine” in the future.

So understood, the idea of agency helps us see that our character is not a surface manifestation of some deeper reality called the “self.” We are our character. But many feel that is not enough. If we are to be genuinely free, a transcendental “I” is required that ensures that we will never be completely contained by our character. The difficulty with this, however, is that such an “I” must be impersonal, free from my history, which is exactly what makes us what we are. “Agency” may not be the best notion in which to ground my idea of character, in that it may continue to draw on an ahistorical view of the self, a transcendental self somehow always “behind” my character, to which I have objected in my criticism of non-qualified ethics. “Agency” as an abstract power may still carry with it the assumption that the self exists in “midair” above history.

Each of us in fact is so molded by the communications we receive from others that we can never disentangle with confidence what we are given and what we do.” 6 In the light of our inability to so disentangle our lives, it remains difficult to maintain that we are agents, that is, that there is a fundamental distinction between what happens to us and what we do. Nevertheless an account of agency is indispensable. It is necessary, however, not to ensure that I can always “act,” but rather to show how I am not without the resources to make my life my own.

This understanding of agency is in stark contrast to those which would try to anchor our “freedom” in a transcendental self. For example, Timothy O’Connell defends what he calls an “onion peel view of the self.” He asks us to think of persons as analogous to onions—that is, as comprised of layers. No layer stands by itself, but each has its own identity. At the outermost layer, as it were, we find their environment, their world, the things they own. Moving inward we find their actions, their behavior, the things they do. And then the body, that which is the “belonging” of a person and yet also is the person. Going deeper we discover moods, emotions, feelings. Deeper still are convictions by which they define themselves. And at the very center, in that dimensionless pinpoint around which everything else revolves, is the person himself or herself—the I. 8 O’Connell notes that this “I,” this dimensionless pinpoint, cannot be an object, since if it were it would need another subject to know it as object.

According to O’Connell, our freedom can only be grounded in the fact that “we experience ourselves as men and women who are free, not only as agents but also as persons.” This latter, central core of myself, the “I” which is my personhood, is confronted with a reality that transcends all categories. It is confronted with the reality of my world, my situation, by body, my feelings, my attitudes and prejudices. In fact it is confronted even by the condition of the possibility of that reality: namely, God. And from the perspective of my own core, the subjectivity that I am, this cosmically inclusive objectivity presents itself for decision. A simple, singular decision: yes or no. The freedom of the human person, then, is not categorical freedom at all. Rather it is a freedom that transcends all categories, it is “transcendental freedom.” 11 O’Connell is never clear, however, on the relation between this “transcendental freedom” and “categorical freedom.” One begins to suspect that this distinction involves all the virtues and problems of Kant’s distinction between the noumenal and phenomenal worlds.

From O’Connell’s perspective, and I might add it is shared by many, our real identity is not our history, but the “fundamental stance” or “option”—that is, a stance by which we exercise that transcending kind of freedom in order to define ourselves as persons. 13 This seems to imply that fundamental option is but the name given to the moment in which that stance is assumed or emphatically renewed. It is that deeper meaning and significance some of the decisions we make in our lives seem to have. But, ironically, such a “moment” cannot be “in history,” as its power lies exactly in its ability to transcend history. One cannot help but be sympathetic to the kind of problem to which O’Connell speaks in his language of “fundamental option,” but this view results in a distorted account of the self that is conceptually confusing. For example, O’Connell says that the “fundamental option” is not really something we “do”; rather it is the term we use to describe what is “really going on” within the rich activity of our lives. 14 Why, then, is it called an option?

This is particularly the case if we must allow, as Outka suggests, that our very doing often includes—perhaps even depends upon—what has happened to us. However, the distinction between what I do and what happens to me is still important insofar as it calls attention to the inevitability of describing behavior intentionally. The language of agency reminds us that our behavior cannot be satisfactorily analyzed in terms of inanimate behavior. That is, any attempt to describe human behavior completely in terms of random causation—causally relating our actions as one random event to another—is doomed to failure.

In other words, our sin—our fundamental sin—is the assumption that we are the creators of the history through which we acquire and possess our character. Sin is the form our character takes as a result of our fear that we will be “nobody” if we lose control of our lives. Moreover our need to be in control is the basis for the violence of our lives. For since our “control” and “power” cannot help but be built on an insufficient basis, we must use force to maintain the illusion that we are in control.

It is a slow achievement as we work day in and day out to locate ourselves within God’s story. We inherently resist such a locating because we have come to love our sinfulness—and we fear losing it. In this respect the emphasis in recent theology on sin as a fundamental orientation of self, rather than sin being associated with certain wrongful acts, is essentially correct. For example, O’Connell tries to provide this kind of interpretation of sin by utilizing the notion of “fundamental option.” Mortal sin as an act is nothing else than a synonym for fundamental option. A mortal sin. . . is the act by which we substantially reject God and assume instead a posture apart from and in alienation from God.

He rightly wants to emphasize that sin reaches and determines the fundamental orientation of the self, that is, it determines our very relationship with God. Yet he wants to avoid the idea that sin is a given, but then neither is it a matter of choice. What then is it? It seems he needs an account of the self in which our actions are rooted in what most nearly makes us what we are, so that sin becomes the qualification of the self rather than of actions. But the language of “fundamental option” does not really serve his purpose, since to protect self-freedom the “fundamental option” must be free of determination by our actions or history. He thus seems caught on the horns of a dilemma by locating sin in “transcendental freedom,” for it is not clear how sin can reach to the depths of who we are and still be something we do.

THE TASK OF CHRISTIAN ETHICS It seems a little odd at this point to ask what the task of Christian ethics might be. Surely that should have been first on the agenda. In fact I have already started to do some Christian ethics insofar as I have argued that Christian ethics has a peculiar stake in narrative, vision, the virtues, and character as constituents of the moral life. For, as we saw, it is impossible to delineate the central concepts of an ethic without exposing the material content, the particular convictions, of that ethic. So in a sense one can ask about the task of Christian ethics only after it has begun. But the matter is even more complex than this. For example, it seems straightforward enough to suggest that the primary task of Christian ethics is to understand the basis and nature of the Christian life. Yet a phrase like “understand the basis and nature of the Christian life” is filled with ambiguity. Does “understand” imply that the task is primarily descriptive? Is the chief concern to map the relation between Christian belief and behavior? Or does “understand” involve a normative task? Is the task of Christian ethics to recommend what we ought to do?

As we shall see, how Christian ethics is understood has always been dependent on its context in a specific tradition. The development of moral theology in Roman Catholicism through the centuries became tied to the penitential system. Moral theologians aided confessional practice as they developed the casuistical detail necessary to sustain and inform the priestly function. Thus the study of moral theology was primarily a task performed by priests and through their preaching and confessional practice they helped the community determine minimum standards of behavior. Such an approach was not minimalistic in principle but became so precisely because the primary concern of the confessional was with avoiding evil. 1 Although moral theologians served an ecclesial function, their work was thought to be based primarily on “natural law.” This may well suggest that the alleged transparency of the natural law norms reflects more the consensus within the church than the universality of the natural law itself.

Though it was often systemized in the language of the virtues, it evidenced little concern for or analysis of the actual development of virtue but instead concentrated on the fulfillment of specified duties. Moral theologians came to look more like lawyers than theologians. They were people skilled in adjudication of cases for the troubled conscience (no mean or small skill). Moreover, even though they were called “theologians,” these moralists seldom were required to make direct theological appeals. Theological claims set the backdrop that made their work intelligible—e.g., God is the creator of a rational universe and moral law can be thus known without the aid of revelation. Beyond that, little theological reflection was required for explicating the nature of the Christian moral life.

In fact Protestants did not develop any specialized discipline called “Christian ethics” until recently. Of course they did not have the confessional, as did Catholics, but that was not the decisive reason for their lack of any explicit discipline called Christian ethics. Rather the Protestant emphasis on God’s free grace made “ethics” an inherently doubtful enterprise, since “ethics,” from such a perspective, appeared as an attempt to presumptively determine God’s will or to substitute works for faith.

Interestingly enough, the more concrete form of analysis undertaken to guide behavior among Protestants tended to be done pastorally and, as a result, was often not informed by explicit theological convictions. Therefore, even though Protestant ethical reflection seemed richer theologically than Catholicism’s, it tended to be as culturally assimilationist as the natural law tradition. In the absence of any disciplined and practical form of ethical reflection, Protestants could only assume that “Christian ethics” was little different from the consensus of whatever culture they found themselves a part.

It occasioned courses in Protestant seminaries dealing with “Christian sociology.” Soon internal criticism of some of the enthusiasm of the Social Gospel required such courses to take a more reflective and critical standpoint. Thus the work of H. R. Niebuhr represents the attempt to make Christian ethics a discipline whose task is to clarify the moral implications of Christian theological convictions. 3 Such work is seen to be primarily analytical and descriptive, but without explicit normative prescriptions. This brief and inadequate attempt to characterize Christian ethics in Catholic and Protestant traditions is meant only to make us aware that the activity we call “Christian ethics” is anything but singular or clear.

Their explicit ethical reflections were primarily occasioned by their pastoral concerns. Thus they seldom give systematic presentations of the Christian life but engage in a sort of ad hoc reflection, since their primary concern was to respond to the needs of a particular community. Indeed, there is something to be said for still labeling ethics a pastoral discipline. Nor do we get “ethics” as separate treatises in the highly systematic Middle Ages. Aquinas never stopped to say: “Now I am going to do a little ethics.” The “ethics” he does in the Prima-Secundae and Secunda-Secundae of the Summa Theologica is but the continuation of his theological portrayal of God’s extension of himself to man so that man might have a way to God. 5 “Ethics” is not done as an independent discipline, but because such considerations are necessary to depict our journey with God.

When nature-grace, creation-redemption are taken to be the primary data of theological reflection, once they are abstracted from the narrative and given a life of their own, a corresponding distortion in moral psychology seems to follow. Since the material content—that is, the rightness or wrongness of certain behavior—is derived from nature, Christian convictions at best only furnish a motivation for “morality.” As Joseph Fuchs says, The specific and decisively Christian aspect of Christian morality is not to be sought first of all in the particularity of categorical values, virtues, and norms of various human activities. Rather it resides in the believer’s fundamental Christian decision to accept God’s love in Christ and respond to it as one who believes and loves, as one who assumes the responsibility for life in this world in imitation of Christ, that is, as one who has died with Christ and is risen with him in faith and sacrament thus becoming a new creation.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 144, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.062933"}

Therefore the very integrity of self, the character required for moral agency, is lost. For, as we saw in the preceding chapter , our very ability to be moral agents is dependent on our having a character that forges a link between what we do and what we are.

To be Christian is surely to fulfill the most profound human desires, but we do not know what such fulfillment means on the basis of those desires themselves.

In this sense the Christian tradition only illumines human values, supports them, provides a context for their reading at given points in history. 18 But McCormick does not tell us what, if anything, such an illumination adds to the ethical; in effect he assumes that the primary task of Christian convictions is to “support” human values. But this assumption presumes that Christians will never be radically anti-world—that is, aligned against the prevailing values of their cultures. In fact behind the emphasis on the “human” character of Christian ethics is a deep fear that there might be a radical discontinuity between Christians and their culture. The result, I fear, is that too often natural law assumptions function as an ideology for sustaining some Christians’ presuppositions that their societies—particularly societies of Western democracies—are intrinsic to God’s purposes. 19 McCormick says, “If Christian faith adds new material (concrete, behavioral) content to morality, then public policy is even more complex than it seems.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 149, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.062938"}

What, for example, would have been the result if Christians had approached their entry into Roman society with McCormick’s presuppositions? Isn’t it possible that Christians, because of the ethos peculiar to their community, might find themselves in deep discontinuity with the ethos of a particular society? Therefore the question of the distinctiveness of Christian ethics—or as I have put it, the insistence on the significance of the qualifier—also involves questions of the relationship of church to world. Indeed, how the task of Christian ethics is to be conceived is as much an ecclesiological issue as an issue having to do with nature and grace, creation and redemption. In fact, the issues are closely interrelated, since often how church is understood in relation to world follows from how nature and grace are thought to be related.

In this sense sanctification is a life of service and sacrifice that the world cannot account for on its own grounds. Therefore, claims for the distinctiveness of the church, and thus Christian ethics, are not attempts to underwrite assumptions of superiority or Christian dominance.

We have a saving God, and we are saved by being invited to share in the work of the kingdom through the history God has created in Israel and the work of Jesus.

Against this view, I propose two basic types of difficulty. The first is theological in character. I argue that the picture of God which inevitably emerges from this kind of approach is one which Christians are themselves unwilling to accept consistently. On this model, I argue God must emerge as an arbitrary figure who would have no legitimate claim on our belief or our allegiance; yet one of the clearest themes of the Judaeo-Christian tradition in the Bible is that God is someone whom man can accept as the ultimate answer to his legitimate aspirations.

Every one of you shall revere his mother and his father, and you shall keep my sabbaths: I am the Lord your God. Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods. I am the Lord your God.” Or again Leviticus 19:11–12: “You shall not steal, nor deal falsely, nor lie to one another. And you shall not swear by my name falsely, and so profane the name of your God: I am the Lord.” The biblical Commandments do not command us arbitrarily; rather they call us to be holy as God is holy, as we have learned of holiness through God’s faithfulness to us. Therefore, like God we are called to be what we are and to do what we do (e.g., we leave part of our fields unharvested for the poor) because God is that kind of God. Such a morality requires no “foundation”; it is enough that we know it to reflect the very nature of God.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 164, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.062957"}

But such a people can survive only if their commitments to one another are built on commitment to Christ.

We Christians must recognize, by the very fact that we are a people of a book, that we are a community which lives through memory. We do not seek a philosophical truth separate from the book’s text.

Such a remembering was no simple mental recollection, rather the image remembered formed the soul and determined future direction. “To remember the works of Yahweh and to seek him, i.e., to let one’s acts be determined by his will, is in reality the same. Consequently, to ‘remember’ the ‘Way’ from the Reed Sea onwards is to act now on the basis of the relationship between God and Israel there revealed, and in so doing to appropriate it, and know it to be most real.” 8 Thus the call of the prophets to Israel was always a summons to return to the vocation of an imitator Dei: God “asks of men that they shall reflect his own character, so far as it can be reflected within the limitations of human life. . . . When the prophets denounced harshness and oppression and called for compassion for the unfortunate, they were calling men to reflect the character which was uniquely expressed in God’s deliverance of his people.” 9 For Israel, therefore, to love God meant to learn to love as God loved and loves.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 183, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.068282"}

The king, the prophet, and the priest were judged by how well they dedicated their lives to being suitable models for the people to imitate. As a result there was a clear tendency in Israel for the three functions to coalesce in one figure—for example, Moses or the servant in the “Servant” songs of Isaiah.

By learning to imitate Jesus, to follow in his way, the early Christians believed they were learning to imitate God, who would have them be heirs of the kingdom. How Jesus’ life was seen as the recapitulation of God’s way with Israel is perhaps nowhere better presented than in the temptation narratives. For in the wilderness Jesus, like Israel, discovers his vocation through being tempted to pervert God’s gifts to Israel. In the first temptation we see Jesus so identified with Israel that he experiences Israel’s perennial desire for certainty of her own choosing. Is he to be like Moses and turn stone to bread? Surely it would be a good thing to turn stone to bread, to be a ready resource to feed the hungry and the poor.

Peace will come only through the worship of the one God who chooses to rule the world through the power of love, which the world can only perceive as weakness. Jesus thus decisively rejects Israel’s temptation to an idolatry that necessarily results in violence between peoples and nations. For our violence is correlative to the falseness of the objects we worship, and the more false they are, the greater our stake in maintaining loyalty to them and protecting them through coercion. Only the one true God can take the risk of ruling by relying entirely on the power of humility and love. Finally, Jesus is tempted to act as the priest of priests, to force God’s hand by being the sacrifice that God cannot refuse. In short, Jesus is tempted to play the hero, to take his life in his hands, to be in control of his destiny, and thus to force God’s kingdom to be present because of his sacrifice.

The temptation narratives are but a particularly concentrated example of how the early church understood Jesus’ life as recapitulating the life of the Lord with Israel. The baptism, the turning to Jerusalem, the cleansing of the temple, the last supper, the crucifixion, and the resurrection were equally understood to be the deliberate representing of Jesus as Israel’s king-messiah. But also the calling of the twelve, the necessity of wandering throughout Israel, the signs on the sabbath, the desert feedings, and the special attention to the poor and the outcast are understood to be at once recapitulation and innovation of the life of Israel and her relationship to God. 11 Thus it is not surprising that the early Christians assumed that by imitating the “Way” of Jesus they were imitating the “Way” of God himself.

So he has no need to lord over out of fear or to get others to serve him; and his commitment to serve is courageous, for he loses his life by so doing.

But such a power, exactly because it is a genuine and truthful power, does not serve by forcing itself on others. Thus he “calls” the disciples and teaches them to be faithful, but he does not try to control their responses.

But we do not dispossess ourselves just by our willing, but by being offered a way of selfless power.

He comes to announce the kingdom as a present reality. To what extent he understood then how his life would be chosen by God to be the means by which that kingdom would be made a reality to all people, we have no way of knowing. What is significant is not what Jesus may or may not have thought about himself, though he certainly acted as one having authority (Matt. 12:28), but that he was obedient to his calling and therefore is the sign and form of the reality of God’s kingship then and now. To begin to understand Jesus’ announcement of the kingdom we must first rid ourselves of the notion that the world we experience will exist indefinitely. 15 We must learn to see the world as Israel had learned to understand it—that is, eschatologically. Though it sounds powerful and intimidating, in fact it is quite simple, for to view the world eschatologically is to see it in terms of a story, with a beginning, a continuing drama, and an end.

It has long been noted that in the Gospels we have texts that indicate variously that the kingdom is coming, that it is present, and that it is still to come. Several theories have been proposed as to how these statements might be reconciled. Some suggest that one or another tense cannot have been Jesus’ own words. They either identify him with the more immediate apocalyptic expectation or suggest that he saw the kingdom to come in the future. I would agree, however, with A. E. Harvey that the whole question is irresolvable in the terms in which it is raised. 17 Not only do we lack the means to know what is Jesus’ view and that of the early church, but it by no means follows that Jesus had a rigorously consistent view.

Thus the Gospels portray Jesus not only offering the possibility of achieving what were heretofore thought to be impossible ethical ideals. He actually proclaims and embodies a way of life that God has made possible here and now. Jesus directs our attention to the kingdom, but the early followers rightly recognized that to see what that kingdom entailed they must attend to his life, death, and resurrection, for his life reveals to us how God would be sovereign. Therefore to learn to see the world eschatologically requires that we learn to see the life of Jesus as decisive for the world’s status as part of God’s kingdom.

Thus the affirmation of God’s sole kingship implies not military revolt but the submission of one’s whole life to the regulations of the Torah, notably to its ritual prescriptions. It means severing oneself from all that is outside the realm of God’s rule, viz., from all who do not ‘take the yoke upon themselves’. . . . Taking the yoke of the kingdom upon oneself is associated with the necessity of daily set prayers and of following a complex set of ritual prescriptions.

No doubt Jesus’ and the early church’s understanding of the kingdom bore similarities to each of these alternatives.

On three matters which were of central importance to the Pharisees—a detailed code of observances, a careful selectiveness in the company they kept, and a concern for the authority of the tradition in which they stood—Jesus adopted a radically different stance. 21 Jesus’ openness to the “unclean,” for example, is but one of the ways we see how his understanding of God’s sovereignty was a challenge to that of the Pharisees.

Freed from our need to coerce, we learn “not to be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on.

The most general name we give that community is church, but there are other names for it in the history of Christianity. It is “the way,” the body of Christ, people of God, and a plethora of images that denote the social reality of being Christian and what it means to be a distinctive people formed by the narrative of God. We should remember that the name “church” is no less an image than “people of God.” In fact, one of the issues in theology is which images of the church are primary or controlling for the others.

We are not individuals who come into contact with others and then decide our various levels of social involvement. We are not “I’s” who decide to identify with certain “we’s”; we are first of all “we’s” who discover our “I’s” through learning to recognize the others as similar and different from ourselves. Our individuality is possible only because we are first of all social beings. After all, the “self” names not a thing, but a relation. I know who I am only in relation to others, and, indeed, who I am is a relation with others. 1 But the claim that Christian ethics is a social ethic is even stronger than those now commonplace observations about the self’s sociality. We have seen that the content of Christian ethics involves claims about a kingdom. Therefore the first words about the Christian life are about a life together, not about the individual. This kingdom sets the standard for the life of the church, but the life of the kingdom is broader than even that of the church.

As his people we become part of his sacrifice, God’s sacrifice, so that the world might be saved from sin and death. These rites, baptism and eucharist, are not just “religious things” that Christian people do. They are the essential rituals of our politics. Through them we learn who we are. Instead of being motives or causes for effective social work on the part of Christian people, these liturgies are our effective social work. For if the church is rather than has a social ethic, these actions are our most important social witness. It is in baptism and eucharist that we see most clearly the marks of God’s kingdom in the world. They set our standard, as we try to bring every aspect of our lives under their sway. 10 Baptism and eucharist are our most fervent prayers and set the standard for all of our other prayers. For prayer is not our pleading to an unmoveable or unsympathetic, but all-powerful God. Rather it is through prayer that we learn to make ourselves open to God’s presence.

In his illuminating book about his missionary work with the Masai, Vincent Donovan powerfully illustrates the inherent relation between our holiness as a people and our eucharistic celebrations. One of the most significant gestures for the Masai is to offer one another a handful of grass as a sign of peace, happiness, and well-being. During arguments, for example, a tuft of grass might be offered by one Masai to another as an assurance that no violence would erupt because of the argument. “No Masai would violate that sacred sign of peace offered, because it was not only a sign of peace; it was peace.” 12 Donovan describes how the beginning of a mass among the Masai would involve the whole village as every activity of the village, from praying for the sick to dancing, would become a natural part of the mass.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 245, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.073639"}

Each of them, in our current situation, tends to underwrite a view of society as essentially a collection of individuals who are engaged in continual bargaining procedures to provide mutual security without letting it cost too much in their personal freedom. Questions of the common purpose of such societies simply cannot be asked. Distinctions between society and state, while perfectly intelligible in a formal mode, make little empirical sense, because “society” lacks a sufficient narrative to give it moral substance. The church, to be sure, has a stake in a “limited state,” but what keeps the state limited is not finally a theory about the place of the state within society but a people who have the power of discernment and know when to say “no.” 17 Thus to say that the church must pursue societal justice is certainly right, but it is not very informative.

Of course there is much to be said for procedural norms, but they can never be sufficient to sustain the conversation necessary for a people to survive as a good people.

The state uses violence to restrain those who have no respect for the lives and rights of other people in that society.

For the telos in fact is a narrative, and the good is not so much a clearly defined “end” as it is a sense of the journey on which that community finds itself. In political terms it means that the conversation of community is not about some good still to be realized, but the conversation is the good insofar as it is through the conversation that the community keeps faithful to the narrative.

In short, they tell us that if we do this or no longer disapprove of that, we will no longer be living out the tradition that originally formed us. The stories that comprise a living tradition, if they are serious, are meant to tell us the way things are—that is, we learn from them the conditions of truth. Reexamining the prohibitions required by particular narratives is one of the ways the narratives are tested against our ongoing experience. In this way the narrative is challenged and renewed. For example, the current abortion controversy is not simply a question of the permissibility of abortion. If it can be shown that Christians have been wrong to prohibit abortion and yet that prohibition is in fact integral to Christian convictions, it follows that there is something basically wrong with how Christians understand the nature of human existence. On the other hand, a moral crisis may suggest that a community has not rightly understood the practical force of its own convictions.

Thus our culture’s current acceptance of abortion as morally acceptable may be shown to be “unnatural” if we are also to continue to be a people who will bring children into the world and to care for them.

It is all very well to say that “decisions are what we make when everything else has been lost,” 5 but clever rhetoric finally cannot distract us from the real issues. No matter what narrative we find ourselves in or what virtues we have acquired, we do find ourselves having to make choices that require justification. “Quandary ethics” may have overlooked the significance of character and virtue for the moral life, but emphasis on the latter cannot relieve us from the need to justify our moral decisions in a consistent and nonarbitrary manner. Indeed total emphasis on narrative and virtue may seem to invite just such arbitrariness.

There is nothing about an emphasis on narrative and the virtues that in itself denies that we must still make decisions or that we are often rightly required to justify why we have acted as we have. However, it is true that those decisions do not have the same status they assume in ethics that ignore the significance of the virtues. For at least part of the intention of an ethics of virtue is to free us from the assumption of the felt “necessities” and “givens” we too often accept as part of our decisions. We often do not have to decide, at least not in the way assumed. For example, those who identify with a nonviolent stance are often challenged with “But what would you do if. . .?” The dots are usually filled in with a description of a case where it seems absolutely essential, and certainly for the greatest good, to use rather than refrain from violence.

For it is my contention that if we are genuinely non-violent we can no more decide to use violence even if the situation seems to warrant it, than the courageous can decide, under certain conditions, to be cowardly. For as John Howard Yoder has pointed out, the challenge “What would you do if. . .?” assumes a relationship between persons that is mechanistic: if I turn the machine one way it will follow one course inevitably, if I push a different set of buttons the machine will clearly operate in another direction. It is assumed that I am the only party making decisions in the total process. The attacker is so pre-programmed that he will not be making any more decisions. His only desire is like an automaton to do the worst evil he can, or the particular evil he has fixed his mind on.

Moreover, those “necessities” too often simply assume that among the givens are my limits or the limits of my community, and never think of suggesting ways in which the community and myself might be asked to change our lives. For example, arguments for the permissibility of abortion often turn on cases of twelve-year-old girls who have become pregnant through rape or incest.

Yet what I am ultimately defending is not really the innocent neighbor in the form of my wife or child, but I am defending what is mine. 7 To recognize this does not mean that I should not defend my wife and child, but it does put the issue in a different frame. For as Yoder suggests, it is not a foregone conclusion for Christianity, as it is for ethical systems which locate value in the self and its relations, that defense of the victim is overriding. “Christianity relativizes the value of self and survival as it affirms the dignity of the enemy and offender. In the face of this specific Christian claim, what seems prima facie evident becomes arguable.” 8 This point reminds us that the description under which the decision is proposed is as important as the decision itself. For the description frames the decision.

Second, there is the possibility of martyrdom for either the victim or myself. For Yoder reminds us that “Christians have held that the death of a Christian believer, as a result of his behaving in a Christian way at the hands of the agents of evil, can become through no merit of his or her own a special witness and a monument of the power of God. The death of that Christian disciple makes a greater contribution to the cause of God and to the welfare of the world than his staying alive at the cost of killing would have done.

If that is the case we are indeed in a fine mess, for if there is anything we need freedom from it is the need to make constant decisions about whether to be sexually faithful or not. For example, I have a friend who travels a great deal. Anyone who travels knows that there is something inherently tempting about getting on airplanes and going places where you are not known well. The experience conveys a freedom that might allow a casual sexual engagement where no strings are attached or any consequences ever follow. My friend, who confesses he often enjoys fantasizing in such a manner, was once taken aback when while he was on an almost empty plane returning to his home a stewardess actually proposed that they might enjoy one another’s company for awhile. My friend candidly admits that the first thing that occurred to him was not the rule “Thou shalt not commit adultery” but, “How could I explain to my wife why I was late?” But that question was enough for him to refuse the offer, because it occurred to him he would have to lie, and while he might even have thought up a good lie, he simply did not want to have to begin that kind of life.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 281, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.077195"}

I expect that many of our decisions are of this sort. We tend to think of them as “decisions,” when in fact they are but confirmation of what we have become without realizing it. That recognition, of course, works as much negatively as it does positively. We may discover our “unfaithfulness” by our needing to make a decision at all. Or in regard to violence, we seldom recognize how deeply filled with hate, resentment, and violence we are. Often this is true of those who are pledged to be nonviolent, as their explicit commitment may be a strategy for gaining power over others in the name of moral righteousness.

It is as if the individual simply bumps up against decisions devoid of any communal context.

Indeed the primary task of casuistry is to help us understand our interconnectedness so that we can better appreciate how what we do not only fits within the story of our lives, but also how it is determined by and determines the ongoing story of the Christian community. Though currently casuistry is regarded with a good deal of suspicion as a minimalist endeavor to evade some of the more onerous obligations of a legalistic ethic, no community can or should try to avoid developing a tradition of moral testing embodying the wisdom of that community concerning sets of issues peculiar to its nature.

Christian thought labels as “pride” that rebellious autonomy which I insist on despite the fact that ultimately, if not overcome by His grace, it means my own destruction. Common sense says that any person is limited in his capacity to observe and evaluate the facts by his particular point of view and the limits of his vision; but Christian faith tells me that my selfish mind, my impatient and retaliating spirit, and my adrenalin positively warp the way I perceive the facts in order to make them reflections of my self-esteem and my desire to be independent of my Creator and of my neighbor.

The church not only is, but must be, a “community of moral discourse”—that is, a community that sustains a rigorous analysis of the implications of its commitments across generations as it faces new challenges and situations. 18 For as I suggested above, as a people, often we do not understand the implications of the narrative that gives us our being. The church is that community pledged constantly to work out and test the implications of the story of God, as known through Israel and Jesus Christ, for its common life as well as the life of the world. There is no assurance that this “working out” will always be faithful to the kind of discipleship required by Jesus.

The proof is definitely in the pudding as we must constantly be open to the possibility that the practice may come to distort the kind of people we are meant to be as the first fruits of the kingdom. For example, we may have been wrong to discount the arguments against usury, especially as usury was first condemned as a sin against charity. A people who are pledged to care for one another so that everything they have is at the disposal of others surely must look with some concern at the attempt to make a profit from others’ needs. Of course, it can be objected that borrowing is not all just for need, but to reinvest for profit and that should not be condemned. This is exactly the kind of discrimination that the casuistry of the Christian people must develop. But even if such a distinction is developed, it, of course by no means grants a blank check on all lending-for-profit practices.

For violence is often the result of the lies and half-truths we perpetrate on one another. And when the falsehood is discovered it becomes the seed of resentment and hate, inviting retaliation and violence that often takes the form of another lie. Therefore the church must be a community that demands truthfulness in all its dealings with one another and the world.

Richard Niebuhr wrote an article for the pacifist-leaning journal The Christian Century in which he tried to provide a theological rationale for accepting the helplessness he thought was the only possible moral response to this event. Niebuhr was not naive and he well understood that this invasion signaled international unrest that could easily lead to wider military confrontations. In the article, entitled “The Grace of Doing Nothing,” he argued that in such circumstances where there simply seemed to be nothing anyone could do that might be productive, there was at least a way of “doing nothing” that was theologically significant. 1 At the behest of the editors of Christian Century his brother, Reinhold, responded to his article arguing strenuously that Christians must act using the means offered by the state to limit coercively such behavior before it resulted in even worse consequences. 2 Among professional theologians these articles are regarded as minor classics, and they remain acutely relevant to our current situation.

Thus the issues the Niebuhrs debated in 1932 remain as relevant today as they were then. I think, therefore, we can do nothing better than to attend to their arguments in detail in order to better understand our own alternatives. H. Richard Niebuhr began his article by noting that everyone is extremely anxious to do something constructive concerning this outbreak of hostilities, but there seems little constructive that can be done. Resolutions are passed, letters to congressmen are written, but such “actions” are done with the melancholy consciousness that they will have little effect. Yet that very consciousness of our powerlessness can be self-deceiving, since we know that even when we do nothing “we are also affecting the course of history. The problem we face is often that of choice between various kinds of inactivity rather than of choice between action and inaction.” 3 But the question remains what kind of inactivity we should engage in and how we should understand it.

Still another form of inactivity is that of the conservative who does nothing in such a crisis, believing that the way of Japan is the way of all nations. In the international arena self-interest is the only law of life. Moreover, the only good that can result in such a context is that which comes from the clash of national self-interests.

Here is inactivity with a long vision, steadfast hope and a realistic program of non-interfering action. 4 But Niebuhr notes that there is yet another way of doing nothing that appears highly impracticable because it rests on the almost obsolete presupposition that there is a God. And oddly enough this view shares most with the communist assumptions about their inactivity. Like the communist, those who share such a belief do not believe simply because people can do nothing constructive that nothing constructive is being done. Like the communist, they believe that there is a force in our history that will ultimately create a different kind of world than we experience.

Christians, like communists, believe something very constructive can be done in preparation for the future. Namely, Christians can build cells of those within each nation who, divorcing themselves from the program of nationalism and of capitalism, unite in a higher loyalty which transcends national and class lines of division and prepare for the future. There is no such Christian international today because radical Christianity has not arrived as yet at a program and a philosophy of history, but such little cells are forming. The First Christian international of Rome has had its day; the Second Christian international of Geneva or Stockholm is likely to go the way of the Second Socialist international. There is need of and opportunity for a Third Christian international. 6 Yet Niebuhr also notes that there are great dissimilarities between Christian and communist inactivity. For the Christians, awareness of their inactivity is but a reminder of our faults, which are actually so like those of the aggressor.

It is not the inactivity of the non-combatants, for it knows that there are no non-combatants, that every one is involved, that China is being crucified (though the term is very inaccurate) by our sins and those of the whole world.

Richard Niebuhr, than a very particular faith in a definite kind of God.

Inevitably these limitations of individuals will achieve cumulative effect in the life and actions of national, racial, and economic groups.” 10 Pure disinterestedness is thus an ideal which an individual cannot achieve and is absolutely impossible for human groups. No nation can ever be good enough to save another nation through the power of love.

Love may qualify the social struggle of history but it will never abolish it, and those who make the attempt to bring society under the dominion of perfect love will die on the cross. And those who behold the cross are quite right in seeing it as a revelation of the divine, of what man ought to be and cannot be, at least not so long as he is enmeshed in the processes of history. 14 Reinhold Niebuhr’s sense of the tragic character of our existence in fact is an attempt to help train us to have souls able to keep up the struggle for justice through the inevitable and ambiguous means of coercion. Hope is surely required to sustain that endeavor, but it is not a hope, according to Niebuhr, that can seek its fulfillment within history.

Richard Niebuhr noted, we can pass resolutions, write our congressmen, but the frustrating thing is that there seems nothing constructive we can do.

But Reinhold Niebuhr was mistaken in suggesting that the tragedy which marks our existence follows from realizing that the limited good we can achieve can only be accomplished ultimately through coercion and violence.

Without such a declaration, patience in the face of the tragic could as easily be but a stoic acquiescence to fate.

On the contrary, it declares that what seems to be an inherent defect in life itself is really a contingent defect in the soul of each man, the defect of the sin which he commits in his freedom.

As David Burrell points out, unless we take the sort of steps which are on a scale modest enough to be incorporated into our own story, we may easily fail to see how the gospel can “apply.” If we do begin to alter the pattern of our lives, however, we will have to explain those actions to ourselves and those close to us. And, as those explanations become part of the fabric of our story, we will be helped to see how the stories of the scriptures help to shape ours as well. What differentiates a constructive response from an ideological reaction is that the first, by definition, alters the patterns of our own lives, while the second rails against “them.” 22 By not trying to do everything, but to do one thing that applies to ourselves and alters our lives, we are led further into God’s peaceable kingdom. For that “one thing” is just enough to remove us from the familiar world of violence so that our imagination might be freed to find yet one other thing we might do. For example, by being a member of a church we might find that we are tied to other churches in other lands in a more profound manner than we are tied to our nation. “Travel” becomes possible or required, since we now realize that we are not tied to place but to a people who are always on the move.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 321, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.080731"}

But that is just the point, because ascetic disciplines are the means to learn to travel in one place. For example, learning the discipline to wait, to be at rest with ourselves, to take the time to be a friend and to be loved, are all ascetic practices that are meant to free us from the normalcy of the world. Through them we are slowly recalled from the world of violence that we might envisage how interesting a people at peace might be. Perhaps the thing that most holds us to the world of violence is our fear that the alternative would entail constant boredom. We need and thrive on conflict, which we assume entails violence. To be lured into the world of nonviolence requires a transformation of our imaginations. We must come to see how exciting an adventure is entailed by God’s offer of peace. But even more than seeing, we come to experience that peace in ourselves and with our friends here and now because we have the assurance that God has made his peace a present reality through his spirit. We can thus take the time to build, as H. Richard Niebuhr suggests, those cells within each nation that unite in a higher loyalty than nation or class—that are in fact God’s international. It may be objected that in a world poised on the brink of nuclear annihilation this is not enough.

The recurring theme of the psalmist, who summarizes as only poets can the sweep of God’s covenanting with his people, is that we are to recount—often and loudly—God’s accomplishments , his great deeds on our behalf. And we? We are asked to be faithful—as he is faithful. Faithful to the way as it will be shown to us by those he sends, his prophets. And, Jesus expresses it similarly when, speaking to his disciples in John’s farewell discourse, he reminds them that they did not choose him: “no, I chose you; and I commissioned you to go out and to bear fruit, fruit that will last” (John 15:16). . . . But, it also spells out the meaning of the startling statement immediately preceding: “I shall not call you servants any more,. . . I call you friends” (John 15:15). As his friends we are liberated from having to prove ourselves by accomplishing great deeds. We are already accepted as intimates. Yet, we are not dispensed from the response characteristic of friendship: to become what the other’s trust would call forth from us. Bearing fruit is more like becoming something than doing something; yet, the results are not only tangible, they are nourishing for others. Bearing fruit is to let ourselves become gift for others. As he did, as he is. 23 Such is the grace of doing one thing. But it is the one thing that draws on the very truth of our existence and the power that sustains the vast depths of the universe. We do it, not because it is effective, but simply because it is true.", "source": "The Peaceable Kingdom", "author": "Stanley Hauerwas;", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 323, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-13T12:44:42.080734"}
