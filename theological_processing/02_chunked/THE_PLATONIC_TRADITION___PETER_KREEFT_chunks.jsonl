It is not a work of advanced and technical “scholarship” but a bit of “philosophizing,” that is, part of the loving search for wisdom. It is not designed for advanced scholars or graduate students in philosophy but for ordinary people, for “beginners.” Its purpose is not to peddle any new theory or ideology about Plato or any new explanation of Plato and Platonism, but simply to matchmake, to get you “hooked.” It treats Plato and Platonism as a single “big idea,” namely what is usually called Plato’s “theory of Ideas” or “theory for Forms,” and therefore it only peripherally deals with the many important secondary ideas in Plato, such as the epistemology of recollection, the policies of aristocracy, or the ethics of the virtues.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 2, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.031018"}

If there is a single word for this it is probably the word “transcendence,” or “moreness.” It defends this wordview or “big picture” mainly by contrast to its typically modern alternative, which can be called reductionism, positivism, materialism, nihilism, or naturalism as opposed to supernaturalism of any stripe, whether religious or not. Finally, it argues for this worldview not so much from its premises or origins as from its conclusions or consequences (in that sense it is an example of what William James called pragmatism), especially its consequences in life, not merely in thought (in that sense it is an example of existentialism).

It is so much the central one that the very existence and survival of Western civilization depends on it. It is like the Confucian tradition in Chinese culture, or the monotheistic tradition in religion, or the human rights tradition in politics. In the first lecture I shall define Platonism and its “big idea,” the idea of a transcendent reality that the history of philosophy has labeled “Platonic Ideas” or “Platonic Forms.” In the second lecture we’ll briefly explore Plato’s two basic predecessors, or sources, myth and Socrates. Then we’ll look at 12 applications of the Forms in Plato’s own dialogs. The third lecture will cover the three most important modifications or additions to Plato himself in the Platonic tradition: Aristotle, Plotinus, and Augustine, each of whom gave the Forms a new metaphysical address. The fourth lecture will explore six Christian Platonists, three in the New Testament and three philosophers, Justin Martyr, Bonaventure, and Aquinas.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 5, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.035916"}

In the sixth lecture we’ll look at 12 influential kinds of Positivism or Reductionism in modern thought: in method, history, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, sociology, politics, logic, linguistics, sex, psychology, and theology, exemplified by Descartes, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Marx, Kant, Mill, Comte, Rousseau, Rawls, Ayer, Derrida, Freud, Skinner, Nietzsche, and Sartre. Lecture 7 will look at the results of abandoning the Platonic tradition in ethics—the values vacuum, or nihilism—in Ecclesiastes, Pascal, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Sartre, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Marcel, and Buber. In the last lecture we’ll look at some experiential evidence for Platonism, doors out of the cave that are still open, signals of transcendence. All this in eight short lectures?

That’s why just about every great philosopher has one “big idea,” one great central idea, a hub from which all other ideas radiate like spokes. For Plato this is the so-called Theory of Ideas, or Theory of Forms—though both terms are misleading, for they are not ideas in anyone’s mind, not concepts; and they are not geometrical forms, shapes, or appearances. They are objective truths, objective realities, that are not visible to the eye of the body but only that of the mind. But the mental eye that sees them is not merely the eye of reasoning or intelligence in the narrow modern sense, but the eye of contemplation or intellectual intuition. To call it Plato’s “Theory of Forms” is misleading for a third reason: it is not a theory first of all but an insight, a sudden, almost mystical experience. It is mystical in the sense that it’s an insight into something absolute, but it’s not mystical in the sense of irrational. In fact it’s supremely rational though not attained by reasoning. This single Big Idea that defines Platonism could be called the “theory of Big Ideas,” because the Platonic Ideas are bigger than any ideas inside of minds, and also bigger than concrete material things outside of minds. They’re “bigger than both of us,” bigger or more real than either concepts or things. They are the standards or patterns for all concepts and all things, and they account for the unity of concepts and things.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 7, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.035927"}

Things become famous, and remembered, because they are loved, and the Republic is loved not for its politics, much of which are absurd, but for its psychology (the world’s first, by the way), and above all for one short passage, the most famous passage in the entire history of philosophy, the parable of the cave, in which Plato invites us to come with him out of our small, comfortable, conventional little shadowland into a startlingly larger world outside this cave, and see the realities of which these shadows are shadows. When we do that, we will at first certainly be confused and blink when we see this sunlight. The reaction of my students to Plato’s Theory of Ideas is typically that of Horatio to Hamlet when he first sees the ghost he did not previously believe in. While Horatio is in this amazed state of mind, Hamlet says to him, “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” That is the essential point of Platonism: moreness, transcendence, another kind of reality outside our cave.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 8, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.035929"}

That’s the modern tendency: to contract, to reduce. And the reason for this is very clear. For only when we reduce the complex to the simple and the mysterious to the clear can we comprehend it scientifically and conquer it technologically. That’s our essential modern project, our main claim to fame, our great success story. Plato’s project is the opposite: not to conquer things by making them smaller but to let ourselves be conquered by something greater. Modern scientific truths are like poker chips with which we can calculate and win. Our mind encloses such truths, and uses them. They work very well. But Plato’s truth is like a cathedral which makes us humbly bow to enter. It encloses us. But we become taller when we bow, for we feel we are in a larger world when we are in a cathedral, or in Plato’s philosophy. The Platonic Ideas are not in our mind; we are in them. They are not our servants; they are our masters. That’s why we experience awe and wonder at them. Most philosophies don’t have that power over our souls. When we speak of awe and wonder we don’t usually think of modern philosophers. But I’ve described only the psychological effect of the idea that I’ve labeled the heart of Platonism.

Very broadly, it means what the Greeks called Logos and what we might translate as order : that reality has an internal order, an intelligibility, a system—that it makes sense. That order is not just our invention—our mind’s imposing structure and meaning—but rather is really there, in everything. It’s discovered rather than invented. Things are ordered because they have intelligible natures or essences. The primary question “What is it?” has real answers. Reality is intelligible to mind. Being is open to reason and reason is open to being. We can also define it more narrowly, as most history of philosophy texts do: it means that there are always universals as well as particulars; that redness and holiness and chair-ness are real just as red things and holy things and chairs are real. It means that adjectives are real just as nouns are; that when two or more things have the same quality, that quality is as real as the things, and (according to Plato) in fact is real independent of those things.

We live in the Shadowlands. (That was the title of the C. S. Lewis movie: a perfect title, because that Platonic insight was Lewis’s essential philosophy.) The whole world we see is an image of a world we do not see, as a painting is an image of something in the painter’s mind. When we see a painting, our mind forms an image of it, but the painting itself is an image of an idea in the painter’s mind. The easiest way to understand this is to think of the painter as God and the painting as the world, so that the whole material universe is a work of art and our understanding of the Ideas it reflects is a kind of mental telepathy with the Mind of the Artist. I’ve used the language of religion because that makes Platonism clearer, even though Platonism is not religion. Plato, like Socrates, was a monotheist but he was quite agnostic about the divine mind, and he nowhere says that it is a divine person ; that identification was a step made later by Christian Platonists. That goes beyond Plato, but not necessarily against him.

Living things like trees or round things like bubbles or just things like societies come into being and pass away, but life and roundness and justice do not.

A third difference is that life and roundness and justice are perfect, perfectly round or perfectly just, while all life is infected with death, and round bubbles are always a little bumpy instead of perfect spheres, and just societies are always mixed with some injustice. C. S. Lewis explains Platonism in The Allegory of Love by calling its worldview “symbolism” and contrasting it to allegory. He writes: “It is of the very nature of thought and language to represent what is immaterial in picturable terms. What is good or happy has always been high like the heavens and bright like the sun. Evil and misery were deep and dark from the first. . . . To ask how these married pairs of sensibles and insensibles first came together would be great folly; the real question is how they ever came apart. . . . This fundamental equivalence between the immaterial and the material may be used by the mind in two ways. . .On the one hand you can start with an immaterial fact, such as the passions which you actually experience, and can then invent visibilia to express them. . . .

But there is another way of using the equivalence, which is almost the opposite of allegory, and which I could call sacramentalism or symbolism. If our passions, being immaterial, can be copied by material inventions, then it is possible that our material world in turn is the copy of an invisible world, of something else. The attempt to read that something else through its sensible imitations, to see the archetype in the copy, is what I mean by symbolism or sacramentalism. . . . The allegorist leaves the given—his own passions—to talk of that which is confessedly less real. . . a fiction. The symbolist leaves the given (the material world) to find that which is more real. Symbolism comes to us from Greece. It makes its first appearance. . . with the dialogs of Plato. The Sun is the copy of the Good. Time is the moving image of eternity. All visible things exist just insofar as they succeed in imitating the Forms.” Plato’s Theory of Forms is the central doctrine of the Republic. The Republic is usually classified as a book about politics. But Plato clearly says in the Republic that he is going to deal with politics only as an analogy, a parallel or illustration, for morality, for ethics. He wants to see the morally good man and the good life more clearly by looking at the good society, because that is bigger and easier to see.

Values depend on facts, on truth. Let me put the same point in another way. You can answer the ethical question—What should we be and do, individually and socially? What is the good life and the good society?—only if you answer the prior anthropological question—What is a human being? Is humanity merely a lucky cosmic accident, a fortunate arrangement of molecules, a chemical equation, an evolved slime pool, an animal which has learned to wear clothes? Is Mind merely Brain?

Let me put the point in still another way—the point about ethics depending on metaphysics. When you read the Republic , you probably wish you could ask this question of Plato: Your picture of the good life in the Republic , both the good society and the good individual, may be a beautiful and noble ideal, Plato, but is it real? There never has been a perfectly good, perfectly just state or a perfectly good, perfectly just individual, so isn’t your ideal just that, your ideal? Your personal opinion, subjective? In your mind, and maybe in mine too, but is it real? Does anything more than Plato justify Plato? Aren’t your so-called Platonic Ideas (such as the Justice you define in the Republic ) merely your ideas? How can they be part of the real world? The typically modern view is that the real world is merely the world we can see and touch, the world we can know best by science—that’s the objective world—and that there’s also a subjective world—an inner world of our private, personal thoughts and opinions and feelings, which we change as often as we change our underwear.

There are then only two places for the good to be: in the objective world of rocks or the subjective world of opinions and feelings. And since values aren’t things like rocks, which we discover, they must be subjective opinions or feelings. Ethics becomes merely “values” that we posit, that we make. Values are not like rocks; we don’t discover them. They’re like art: we create them, both individually and socially, collectively, or culturally. But Plato thinks values are things like rocks. They’re objectively real. In fact, they’re harder than rocks, more real than rocks, more unchangeable, more unyielding than rocks. We don’t see them with the eyes of the body but with the eyes of the mind. But they’re not in the mind any more than rocks are in the eye. This fundamental metaphysical difference between Plato and modernity is the root of a fundamental ethical difference. In the typically modern view, Plato is an unrealistic dreamer and Thrasymachus the Sophist is right when he defines justice as simply the label pinned on the laws by whoever has the power to make them.

(“World” here does not mean “material world” or “planet,” just “some kind of ordered reality.”) This gives us a radically different anthropology. “Know thyself” was the first commandment of the god of the Delphic Oracle; and like Socrates, Plato took that commandment seriously.

Plato calls this belief, because we believe or assume that our senses show us reality, but we don’t prove it. And the level of reality that is the object of sensory belief is actual material objects. A third level is logical and mathematical reasoning, and its object is logical and mathematical truths, like the truths of geometry. These are quantitative, not qualitative; and they are hypothetical, they depend on other truths, as in logic all conclusions depend on their premises. Logic is “if. . . then. . . ” reasoning. The fourth and highest level is knowledge of the Forms. This knowledge is not mere appearance, or belief, or hypothetical reasoning, but direct insight into an unchangeable qualitative Form like Justice or Beauty or Human Nature or Life.

The third is philosophical knowledge of reasons and causes by logical reasoning, getting to the kind of thing Aristotle and Plato both got to. Philosophy, like science, begins in wonder, according to the Greeks, but in science the wonder ends when the knowledge comes. The difference between science and philosophy is that it’s much harder to come to the end in philosophy.

Plato strongly suggests, in many places, like his Seventh Letter and the Phaedrus and the Symposium and in what he says about the Absolute Good in the Republic , that this mystical knowledge, which cannot be put into words, is the whole point of philosophy and, indeed, of human life itself. In addition to these expanded levels in metaphysics and epistemology, Platonism also gives us an expanded ethics or life-view, or practice, as well as an expanded world-view, or theory. The ethical consequence of Platonic Forms can hardly be exaggerated. Because for the ancients ethics is fundamentally about something much more than laws and rights and duties. It’s first of all about the most important question you can ask: what is the end of man, the meaning of life, the summum bonum , the greatest good, the purpose of our existence?

Each archetype is one perfect model for many imperfect imitations, or images. Both in the myths and in Plato’s philosophy the archetypes have an exalted quality, a perfection; they are paradigms, and they have an authority over human lives, which imitate them. The gods’ role as archetypes is exalted in two ways: in time and space. They are exalted in time by being put into the sacred past , when the gods were on earth or closer to the earth; and they are exalted in space by being put into the heavens, at the top of the cosmic totem pole while we mortals are somewhere near the middle.

At most, science admits only a hierarchy of complexity: human brains are more complex than stars. But complexity is still a quantitative notion.

Instead of relying on blind feelings and blind faith in the stories of Homer, which both rose from and appealed to the unconscious imagination, Socrates demanded conscious reasons, definitions, and arguments.

The answer is by definition. A definition expresses the universal and necessary and unchangeable essence of the thing defined, unlike concrete examples which only express what is particular and accidental and changeable. For instance, you cannot define a man as a Greek, or as an adult, or as somebody who looks like Plato, even though Greeks and adults and people who look like Plato are indeed men. You must define man by omitting all the changeable and particular features and find the universal essence. Man is essentially a rational animal, a living organism with a soul capable of reason.

When Socrates announced that the essence of the self was the soul, his contemporaries must have thought he was crazy, because he seemed to them to be saying that your true self is your ghost. Unfortunately, most of us are still primitive pre-Socratic thinkers when we think of the soul, for when our movies show the soul departing from the body at death, it’s always a ghost, a cloud, something insubstantial. If Socrates made a movie about death he’d show the body as a cloud, a rainbow, a short-lived, barely-substantial thing, and the soul would look like a bar of iron. The body is part of me only because it is the home of the soul, for a little while. For after I die, my corpse is no longer me, but my soul is. This is the first Platonic Form to be discovered, the most important one, for if you don’t know yourself, then you don’t know who it is that knows anything else!

Physics is not biology and biology is not math. But philosophy (especially metaphysics) is the study of everything. In the Republic , Plato defines the distinctiveness of the philosopher this way: the philosopher is the one who seeks the whole of beauty, or justice, or wisdom, or whatever the Form it is that he’s seeking, rather than only some part or some area, as the special sciences do. Whether this holistic knowledge is a valid aim, whether it is possible to be such a generalist, whether there are universals that are knowable, is the question that divides Platonists and anti-Platonists throughout the history of philosophy. It divides two kinds of colleges and universities in America today. Some see philosophy merely as a post script and a service department.

Book 1 of the Republic is a typical early Socratic dialog, in which Socrates, after logically refuting three wrong definitions of justice, is left with no right one and is dissatisfied because he hasn’t yet found the Form. And the practical payoff, the reason we need to find it, is because without it we can’t prove that justice is more profitable than injustice, that it alone brings happiness. That’s why the Republic is so important: it’s about the most important question in the world, the good for man, the greatest good, the meaning of life, how to live. By the end of book 1, Socrates has proved this conclusion by logical argument—that justice is always profitable—but we are not convinced, and he does not expect us to be convinced, because we did not know what we were talking about, we did not know the Form, the essence, the real nature, of Justice.

We see it, not just calculate it; we understand it. That is the goal of every dialog: the understanding of what it is, and that is the only thing that totally convinces us and satisfies us. That’s the fourth and highest step in our education. The Republic argues that philosophy is needed for societies as well as for souls, because only the knowledge of the Forms can judge the shadows on the Divided Line and in the cave; only the knowledge of ideal justice can understand and repair real injustices. As Socrates argues, “If a shuttle is broken in the making, will the maker make a second one looking to the broken one as his standard, or will he look to the Form according to which he made the first one?” What is true of shuttles is also true of states, and of souls, that is, of persons.

To the Greek mind, only matter was infinite, and formless, and therefore imperfect; only finite form made it perfect, as it does in any work of art. But in the Republic Socrates amazed his hearers by saying that the Good is infinite, and therefore not definable like other forms, like justice, but it can only be known through analogy, parable, symbol. It’s like the sun. The sun gives light, and light symbolizes truth, definable truth; but the Good itself transcends definition as the sun transcends its light, as its source. The sun is not a lit object. You can’t shine a light on the sun. It is the source of all light as the Idea of the Good is the source of all truth. Everything is what it is because it is somehow good.

Aristotle does not deny the existence of the Forms. They are as central to his philosophy as they are to Plato’s. He is always on the hunt for a Form, a universal, a real essence. Modern philosophers shun Aristotle because of this, because of his Platonism. What Aristotle denies is the chorismos , the separation, of the Forms, in three areas: metaphysics, epistemology, and anthropology. In his metaphysics, he denies that the Forms exist in a separate, spiritual world of their own. They exist only in this world. And that “only” is indeed a subtraction (of the second, separate “world”) from Plato. And perhaps it’s not that much of an addition either, for Plato too said that things “participate” in the Forms. In that sense his Forms are not only transcendent, they are also immanent—rather like God. In his epistemology, Aristotle denies Plato’s doctrine of anamnesis , or recollection: that we have innate ideas of the Forms and need only to remember them under the prod of Socratic questioning.

Aristotle agrees that what makes us distinctively human is our rational soul, so he essentially agrees with Plato, but he adds the body too as part of our essence. He defined man as a rational animal. The practical consequences of this are clear in his Ethics. It begins by seeking the good for man, which is happiness, as Plato says, and it defines this as an active life according to virtue, as Plato also says. While Aristotle adds eight other virtues to Plato’s four cardinal virtues (justice, wisdom, courage, and moderation), he also begins with and concentrates on these four. But then he adds “in a complete life” and “with sufficient bodily goods” to Plato’s definition of happiness. This addition is only secondary; and like Plato, Aristotle says that even with a minimum of bodily goods and in the presence of ordinary suffering, happiness is attainable, for the good and wise man makes the most of whatever fate brings him.

There are three levels of scientific knowledge for Aristotle: (1) physics, which understands universal physical laws (physical Forms) by abstracting from individual physical matter; and then (2) mathematics, which also abstracts from change and uncovers truths that are changeless, whereas physics deals with the world of time and change and motion; and finally (3) metaphysics, which abstracts from all particularity.

He begins by opposing Empiricism and abstraction to Plato’s rationalism and innate ideas, but he ends by founding all knowledge on self-evident first principles like the law of non-contradiction, which are innately known, not abstracted. He begins by making the primary object of knowledge the sensible substance rather than the immaterial Form, but he ends by saying that the ultimate knowledge is the knowledge of God, who is immaterial substance He begins by giving the material world something real of its own, not just a reflection of the Forms. But he ends by saying matter is not actual, only potential. All the actuality in any substance is due to the form, not the matter.

In general, he criticizes Plato for being too otherworldly, and all the history of philosophy books present him as more this-worldly, realistic, and pragmatic than Plato. Yet he says that the ultimate end of philosophy is wisdom and wisdom is the knowledge of God. which means two things: our knowledge of God and the knowledge that God alone has, so that only God is truly wise, just as Socrates said. And the highest form of our knowledge of God is contemplation, not proof.

Plotinus founded Neoplatonism, over five hundred years after Aristotle’s death in 322 BC, and he influenced the Middle Ages more than Plato or Aristotle did, since they knew him better. Plato’s works were not rediscovered until the early years of the Renaissance, and Aristotle’s not until the thirteenth century. Unlike Aristotle, Plotinus always considered himself a totally faithful disciple of Plato rather than an alternative. Yet in some ways Plotinus’s addition was more radical than Aristotle’s, and more of a subtraction. For one thing, Plotinus denied the rationality, the intelligibility, of ultimate reality, of Plato’s Idea of the Good. He sharply separated this ultimate reality, which he called “The One,” from the realm of the Ideas. For another thing, Plotinus said matter was the source of evil, and he had a deep hatred and fear of matter and the body.

They are compatible insofar as they emphasize the transcendence of God over human concepts, of the soul over the body, of heaven over earth, and of the individual’s ultimate destiny in the Beatific Vision over earthly politics and community; but incompatible insofar as they denigrate human reason, matter, the body, this world, and community.

The only one of the 81 treatises of Plotinus that was preserved for the Middle Ages was the first one, the treatise on Beauty, yet this gave a fair and profound sample of the heart of his philosophy. For instance, take the following passage. Beauty is “something detected at first glance, something that the soul, remembering, names, recognizes, gives welcome to, and in a way fuses with. When the soul falls in with ugliness, it shrinks back, repulses it, turns away from it as alien. We suggest that the reason for this experience is that the soul, being what it is and related to the reality above it, is delighted when it sees any signs of kinship, anything akin to itself, takes its own into itself, and is stirred to new awareness of whence and what it really is. . .What is this kinship?

Always struggling aloft, this subtlest of all elements is at the last limits of the bodily. It admits no other into itself, while all other bodies give it entry.” This also explains our fascination with music: “in the realm of sound, unheard harmonies create the harmonies we hear.” And when we come to perceive the Platonic Idea of Beauty itself with the soul, Plotinus says, “we undergo a joy, a wonder, and a distress more deep than any other because here one touches truth. For beauty is genuine reality; ugliness, its opposite. . . . Such emotion all beauty must induce: an astonishment, a delicious wonderment, a longing, a love, a trembling that is all delight. . . . All perceive it. Not all are stung sharply by it. Only they whom we call lovers ever are.” Plotinus describes mystical experience by comparing it to a person so absorbed in reading that he is unaware that he is reading, or even that he exists. He is no longer conscious of himself as the subject; he is now wholly identified with the object.

Self-consciousness always ruins the bliss of these peak experiences. Once you start thinking, “I am now having a mystical experience,” you’re instantly out of the experience. This mysticism is suggested in Plato’s Symposium and Phaedrus. But Plotinus added two things to Plato: much more detail of the experience itself, and another level of metaphysics above Plato’s, a kind of impersonal Trinity of principles that he said explained the world we see. Lowest of the three, and between Plato’s Ideas and the world, was the “world soul,” the efficient cause of all life and motion and time (but not the cause of matter, as the biblical God is the creator of matter). This “world-soul” corresponds roughly to Plato’s creator-god or Demiurge in the Timaeus , and to Aristotle’s efficient cause.

The One as the Good functions as final cause but it is not immanent in things, as it is for Aristotle, and it is not a God, a Person, as it is for Christianity, and it is not a Platonic Form, because it is not intelligible, not definable. It is beyond Intelligence, and even, Plotinus said, “beyond being.” Now this is a very strange thing to say. “Beyond being” sounds like “unreal” or ‘nonexistent.” But Plotinus means almost the opposite, something like “more real than being.” What could that possibly mean? Plotinus meant by “being” not “existence” but “intelligible essence” or “intelligibility.” So the transcendent One is , but it has no essence. But everything knowable has a knowable, intelligible essence. Therefore the One is unknowable. Or instead of saying that the One is unknowable because it’s beyond being, you could say that it’s beyond being because it’s unknowable.

Plotinus’s Trinity of One, Intelligence, and World-Soul is very different from the Christian Trinity, by the way, for two reasons: first, it is not three persons and second, because the three are unequal. They are not one being.

Medieval statuary of Augustine always has him holding an open book in one hand and a burning heart in the other. His philosophy is Platonic in many ways. He agrees with Plato that the true self is the soul (though he thinks the body is much more important than Plato did, as Plato thought it was more important than Plotinus did). He agrees with Plato that true knowledge comes from the soul and its intellect, not the body and its senses, which yield only opinions and uncertainty. He uses Plato’s interior road to truth rather than Aristotle’s exterior, empirical road. In fact, this interior road is his argument for God: our temporal minds can know eternal truth, therefore there must be an eternal mind in which we see this truth. He writes: “Do not go abroad. Return within yourself. Truth dwells in the inward man.” And when we find truth there, the there is adverbial, not adjectival: it modifies the finding, not the truth.

This is all true, but I think this standard line misses the deepest point. I think the essential contribution of Augustine to Platonism is not merely the solution to an intellectual problem in metaphysics. For Augustine the Logos is not a concept. A concept is weaker than what it knows. My concept of human nature is weaker than human nature itself; the concept is less than the reality. But the Logos is more. It is the Mind of the Maker and Modeler. It is the Model and Standard and Archetype.

All the people who have ever lived who have chosen God as the ultimate object of their love, however clearly or obscurely they have known God, are members of the City of God, and destined for eternal union with God in Heaven, since everyone eventually gets what they want, what they love. “ Amor meus pondus meum (my love is my weight, my gravity, my destiny),” Augustine says. And everyone whose ultimate love is this world and themselves, not God, will eternally get that, and not God, and they will be eternally unhappy because all human hearts are designed to be happy only by getting what they are designed to love, namely God. In other words, Augustine essentially adds three h’s to Plato: larger views of hearts, heaven, and hell. Augustine is a perfect example of the Hamlet principle: “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” The real thing is bigger than the biggest concept.

One of the things smaller than ourselves is a concept. Logos is not a concept for Augustine. Logos is God, the Mind of God, the Word of God. And Jesus is the Logos become flesh. The house where all Plato’s Ideas live was an eternal Person who became a temporal person: the Mind of the Author put Himself into the story He designed as one of his own characters.

The Confessions has a larger percentage of interrogative sentences in it than any other philosophical classic except actual dialogs.

As our ideas are images of the things in the world, the things in the world are images of the Ideas. All concrete material beings on earth, including man, are images of the eternal archetypes, which Augustine located in the Mind of God. We can’t push this connection with Plato too far. There are at least three important differences between Plato and the Bible. First, the Bible does not teach a Platonic realm of eternal, abstract, universal essences, because the Bible is not a book of abstract philosophy. What is eternal in the Bible is a single concrete, immaterial being who is a person (though not a human person), whose name is I AM, who is a subject, not just an object, as Plato’s Ideas are.

John is plugging Jesus into Genesis here, and the plug is Platonism. In the Genesis creation story, God creates the universe by His word, by first speaking words—and of course these are not physical words but mental words or Ideas—and then the things that these words mean come into existence. That is precisely Platonism: Plato’s Ideas, unlike our ideas, are not copies of things but things are copies of them. God’s Ideas are prior to things; ours are posterior to things. In us, words copy ideas and ideas copy things, but in God creating things the Ideas come first. And all these many Ideas are unified in the one Idea, or one Word, or one Divine Mind. That is the Logos which, John says, became incarnate in Jesus. So when John said that the Logos became flesh, he meant that what became the man Jesus was all three Logoi : the meaning of all things, and the wisdom that is the understanding of the meaning of all things, and the word that is the revelation of the wisdom that is the understanding of the meaning of all things.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 79, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.049206"}

Already in the second century we find the typical pattern for the interaction between Platonic philosophy and Christianity in Justin’s autobiographical account of his philosophical and religious journey. He was a pagan Roman who came to Athens to study philosophy. Philosophy in the ancient world was not just an academic or scholarly exercise but also a very personal and life-changing thing. In fact it was more like an alternative religion, a total way of life. After all, the word “philosophy” means “the love of wisdom,” not “the game of cleverness.” Justin says the aim of the philosophers had always been “to see God.” There were five main schools of philosophy in Justin’s time: Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, Pythagoreanism, and Epicureanism, which was the only one that was atheistic and materialistic and subordinated wisdom to pleasure. Justin tried all four of the others. The Stoic philosopher he tried first disappointed Justin when he said that he neither knew God nor did he think this knowledge was necessary. Justin next went to an Aristotelian, who haggled so much over prepayment of tuition money that Justin thought “he was not a lover of wisdom but of money.” Next he tried a Pythagorean, who refused to teach Justin philosophy because he had not studied mathematics.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 81, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.049209"}

And how can reincarnation be a remedial punishment and an education if we don’t remember what sins we committed in our previous reincarnation? When Justin confessed that his whole purpose in studying philosophy was to see God, the old man disposed of all pagan philosophers with one question: “How should the philosophers judge truly about God when they do not know Him, since they have never seen Him or heard Him?” When Justin asked the man where he got his wisdom, he replied: Directly, from God’s prophets, who did not need or use argumentation because they were actual first-hand witnesses of God, and proved it by miracles. And when the old man spoke of Christ, Justin said, “straightway a flame was kindled in my soul, and a love of the prophets and the friends of Christ possessed me, and I found this philosophy alone to be profitable.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 82, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.049211"}

Justin then argued with the other pagan philosophers as the old man had done to him, and found that this new religion, though at first accepted by faith, was also the most rational philosophy. Here, in a nutshell, is the experience not only of Justin but of nearly all classical Christian philosophers for the rest of time, and the basis of its dialog with Greek philosophy, especially Plato. There are three stages in the journey. First, Justin seeks wisdom by reason alone, and fails. Then, he accepts divinely revealed wisdom by faith. Finally, he finds that it alone satisfies his reason. He finds in the Christian religion the attainment of philosophical wisdom by non-philosophical methods. Even though Justin is relatively simple and unsophisticated, he is the paradigm case for subsequent Christian philosophers. And “philosophy” meant “Platonism or Neoplatonism” to almost all of them for the first one thousand years of the Christian era. Justin sets the angle, so to speak. An inch of divergence between the two lines at the beginning of an angle can mean a mile’s divergence farther from the point of origin.

How could pagans know so much divine truth? Justin’s answer was that they were in unconscious contact with the pre-incarnate Christ, the Logos , the ultimate source of all truth, the Mind of God. And since Christ is the Logos —this expands the notion of Christ—the Logos is also Christ—and this expands the notion of the Logos. John said of Christ that He is “the light that enlightens every man who comes into the world.” This means, then, that, to use Justin’s own words, “Since He is the Logos of whom every race of men are partakers, therefore those who lived according to Logos (according to Reason) are Christians, even if they were thought to be atheists, as among the Greeks Socrates. For Christ was partially known even by Socrates, for He was and is the Logos who is in every man, as a power of the ineffable Father and not the mere instrument of human reason.” Fourteen hundred years later, Erasmus, in this same tradition, would exclaim, “Saint Socrates, pray for us!” This historically crucial equation of the Logos with Christ changes the Logos more than it changes Christ.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 84, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.049213"}

Logos became dia-logos , dialog. Man had always sought for God, and failed, even at his best, in Plato; but when God sought for man, He succeeded, in Christ. Justin’s experience was like Job’s: Job’s words about God failed, and did not satisfy; when God spoke to Job, God’s Word succeeded, and satisfied Job. And the reason is the Logos. The Logos is the heart of Christian Platonism. When we fast forward to the height of the Christian Middle Ages, the thirteenth century, we find two philosophers, Bonaventure and Aquinas, who exemplified Christian Platonism in very different ways.

Bonaventure used Aristotelian terminology to make Platonic points. As a matter of fact, just about all medieval philosophers before Ockham thought of themselves as synthesizers of Plato and Aristotle, in different ways. Bonaventure relied most on Augustine, especially his doctrine of divine illumination of the intellect by the Platonic Ideas in the Mind of God. This doctrine alone, he argued, explains the presence of eternal and necessary truths in the human soul, for the soul is not eternal or necessary. We are not immutable or infallible, yet these Ideas are. Two plus two must be four, and events must have causes, and goodness must be done and evil avoided. Bonaventure sees the Ideas as exercising a kind of regulative activity on the human mind, like hardware in a computer, as we would say today.

The world is a great cathedral, filled with divinely painted pictures to teach us step by step our own nature and destiny. Everything on earth is an image , a resemblance, a sign, a word that expresses a meaning beyond it. Creatures are words , God’s creating was a speaking , and the universe is a book on which, he says, we read the Trinity on every page. When our eyes are opened, we see God everywhere, because He is everywhere, as an author is everywhere in his book. The four best words to summarize Bonaventure’s philosophy might be these: All things are signs. It is a very Franciscan sensibility. Think of St. Francis’s famous Canticle of the Sun, or, more properly, the Canticle of the Creatures. St. Bonaventure is St. Francis become a philosopher. Semiotics is the modern science of signs.

First, like Augustine, he gives Plato’s Ideas a home in the mind of God. In fact, he explicitly quotes Augustine on this, with approval. So if all red things ceased to exist, the Idea of red would still exist in the mind of God. Here, for Aquinas as well as Augustine, Plato is right and Aristotle is wrong. His second addition to Plato is that there are Ideas of individuals as well as of universals. Each person, each blade of grass, each subatomic particle, is known by God eternally, before it is created. This is really more Platonic than Platonism, not less. The second place the Platonic Ideas exist is in things, as the forms of material substances, just as Aristotle said. Aquinas adds to Platonism an Aristotelian hylomorphism (matter and form together constitute things, or “substances”, as Aristotle calls them).

But even here Aquinas does not reject Augustine and his Platonic epistemology of divine illumination, but synthesizes it with Aristotle’s epistemology of abstraction. Our “active intellect,” which abstracts the form from the matter, is our participation in, and the effect of, God’s intellect. So Aristotelian “abstraction” is the effect of Augustinian “illuminations.

It illuminates us from within rather than from without, and unconsciously rather than consciously, and by nature rather than by supernatural grace; but that’s all true for Augustine too.

Everything earthly was an image of something heavenly; everything in the creation was a reflection of something in the Creator. Remember, God wrote two books, nature and scripture. Both were meant to be read, looked-along rather than just looked-at. That reading raises us above the animals. Somebody who can’t sign-read the book of nature is like a dumb dog who only looks at your finger when you point to where you want him to go instead of reading the sign and looking along your finger so as to understand your mind, your will, your intentions. Animals deal very well with matter, but they can’t understand that matter reveals spirit.

Even though he is an Aristotelian, Aquinas also accepts the three most important theses of Plato’s anthropology: First, the most important part of you is your soul, and the most important thing in life is the care of the soul (and Aristotle agreed with this even though he added the body much more than Plato did).

Just as with the doctrine of the Platonic Ideas, Aquinas rejects not the primary Platonic point but the secondary point about its relationship to other things. Aquinas follows Aristotle in relating the soul more closely to the body than Plato did, just as he follows Aristotle in relating form more closely to matter, Ideas more closely to things, than Plato did. But even Plato had the Ideas related to things by “participation”: things “participate” in their Forms.

So let’s begin with Nominalism. What is it and why is it so destructive? If I were to select just one philosophy and one philosopher to blame for most of the mistakes of modern philosophy, and the most foundational mistakes, I would select Nominalism and blame William of Ockham. I call him a home-wrecker, or a marriage-wrecker. Not only did he put an end to the fundamental program of one thousand four hundred years of Christian philosophy, which was the marriage or synthesis of faith and reason, but within philosophy itself his Nominalism divided what had previously been happily married or united, in every philosophical area: universals and particulars, concepts and their objects, certainty and reality, terms and propositions, consciousness and the world, and the two terms of every analogy.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 100, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.053087"}

This is a very severe judgment, but I shall try to prove it. Nominalism is an answer to a simple question in logic: What is the reality that abstract universal terms like justice or redness or human nature refer to? Sounds like a harmless question about some very abstract idea, but (to quote the very quotable title of an old book) “ideas have consequences.” To understand the question, we have to review some basic logic. Logic is essentially the science of reasoning. Reasoning is the act of the mind by which we prove one proposition to be true (called the conclusion), by deducing it from other propositions (called premises). That’s called an argument. Both the premises and conclusions in an argument are propositions , and propositions are declarative sentences.

According to Nominalism, there is no such thing as human nature, or the nature of man, or man in general; there is only Socrates and Plato. There is no such thing in reality as justice or injustice, only acts that we see as resembling each other in some way so that we choose to use the same term, “just” or “unjust”, to refer to them. “Everything outside the soul is singular”—that is the formula for Ockham’s Nominalism.

Reason is too weak to do that. Faith and reason cannot be married, because Reason is too small, too young to have intercourse with Faith. They can’t have children. In Ockham’s theology, God Himself is totally irrational: There are no universal rules for the divine mind. God is pure will, and totally free, beyond the universal bounds even of logic. Ockham says that God, being omnipotent, could do anything. He could make a square circle. He could make a man a donkey—not just make a man turn into a donkey, but make a man to be a donkey even though he is a man. He says that God could cause the sense experience of a star to exist in us when the star does not exist. He is really denying secondary causality. He’s dividing the real world into totally separate things and events and saying that it could be that God causes each thing or event separately rather than having one thing cause another according to certain universal laws.

God’s primary attribute is not wisdom or goodness or love but power, omnipotence. As we shall see later, this is precisely the crisis in Muslim theology that happened five centuries before Ockham: The Asharites, who embraced Nominalism, Irrationalism, and Voluntarism (will instead of reason) become main-line orthodoxy in Muslim theology. But Nominalism was seen as an aberration in most Christian thought. Another radical consequence of Nominalism is skepticism. Certainty is impossible, only probability is possible. Nominalism obviously entails skepticism, or at least probablism, because if there are no real universals, then no universal statements can be known to be true of objective reality.

Ockham’s logic is strictly mathematical logic, not the Aristotelian logic of ordinary language, where words have analogical meanings, rubber meanings that stretch, meanings that are not wholly the same and not wholly different, e.g. the goodness of God, of man, of animals, of tools, and of ideas. The word “good” is not wholly the same in all those cases, but it’s not wholly different either.

Therefore there can be no such thing as the unity of the human race in common humanity. Since there is no such thing as universal human nature, there is no real universal human community. The same is true of the church or a family. They are only relationships between individuals. There is no such real thing as a community, a common unity of diverse yet unified parts, either among men or among the things in the universe. There is no such thing as cosmic order. Because there is no Logos. Platonism is dead. Next, real causality is denied. Ockham reduces causality to sensory observation that one thing regularly follows another, exactly as David Hume was to do four centuries later. Causality is nothing real, only mental: observed sequence, the mental habit of expecting one thing to follow another again merely because we’ve seen it happen many times before.

Deny everything you possibly can deny. Ockham applied the razor not just to the extra hair on philosophy’s beard but to its neck, its jugular vein. The Razor is his justification for Nominalism, the denial of essences, natures, species, or universals. In epistemology the consequence is the denial of abstraction. Since there are no universals there is no abstracting of them, and therefore there is no need for an active intellect to do the abstracting. The intellect is purely passive, like a blank tablet, a “tabula rasa,” simply receiving data from the senses as a blackboard receives lines from chalk. All the activity is in the chalk. In ethics, Ockham totally severs ethics from metaphysics—goodness from reality—in denying natural law. Natural law has to be universal: universal rights presuppose universal natures: we have human rights because we are all human.

Ockham says that if God willed us to hate Him, or to hate our fellow human being, then hate would be good and love would be evil. Ockham actually says that. This is exactly the philosophy of Islamic terrorists. Here are some of the consequences of Ockham’s Nominalism in modern philosophy. Modern philosophy really begins in the early seventeenth century with Francis Bacon’s Empiricism and Rene Descartes’ Rationalism. These are the two essential parts of the new scientific method: reducing all data to empirical data by insisting on empirical proof for every hypothesis, and reducing all reason to mathematical reason by insisting on exact mathematical measurement and the closest thing to it outside of numbers, viz. “clear and distinct ideas.” This tighter method made for great success in science.

The method can’t handle analogical ideas, “stretch” ideas, ideas with edges that stretch to connect with other ideas in a “more or less” kind of way. The ideal is always mathematics. You could say that Bacon reduced the mind to a camera and Descartes to a computer. David Hume, a century after Bacon and Descartes, is probably the most famous skeptic in history, and certainly the most influential in philosophy. His Nominalism, inherited from Ockham, led to skepticism by a very clear logical route. Hume argues that every proposition must be either what he calls a “relation of ideas” or a “matter of fact.” A relation of ideas is a tautology, provable by the law of non contradiction alone, like 2 + 2 = 4. A matter of fact is something that happens in the world of matter, time, and space, and it’s uncertain until you observe it with your senses.

Once again, it is Platonism that is the central dividing point. Let’s look at the logic here a little more carefully, since Nominalism arose as a doctrine about logic and language.

If a man is bald, it’s by accident, not by essence. Finally, “Man has a sense of humor” or “Man has language” reveals a property, proper accident , or essential property of man: not the very essence but something that flows from the essence, is caused by the essence, and therefore is there in every man.

These philosophy wars are not wholly over, but almost, because many philosophers have found ways to combine the new and the old, to use the new logic to ask the old questions, even questions of metaphysics, instead of just dismissing it all as sophistry and illusion, as Hume did. They are not necessarily Nominalists. What holds analytic philosophers together then? Mainly the use of the new symbolic or mathematical or propositional logic instead of the old Socratic-Platonic-Aristotelian logic.

It is certain that there is no certainty. It is objectively true that truth is not objective. I know that I cannot know. It is only probable that there is only probability.

At the other side in the ninth-century debate from the Asharites, Averroes demoted faith almost as much as his opponents demoted reason. The crisis both sides faced was the apparent contradictions between the Koran and Aristotle, the greatest of philosophers, who denied individual immortality, the creation of the world of time, and divine providence. Averroes taught a kind of double truth theory: that while it was all right for simple people to believe the Koran literally, for educated people and philosophers Aristotle trumped the Koran, and where the two contradicted, the Koran had to be reinterpreted allegorically.

It might be a useful oversimplification at the start to define Nominalism as the denial of any universal objective truths, and Positivism as the denial of any universal objective values. Values, for Positivism, are contrasted with “Facts” and are not based on Logos , on the Platonic kind of reason that knows universals, but on the human will that creates them, that “posits” them. Thus the term “Positivism.” The word “Positivism” was coined by Auguste Comte, the nineteenth-century French atheist philosopher who founded the science of sociology and invented that term. He called his philosophy “Positivism” because he believed that the only knowledge of objective reality was through what he called “positive science.” He didn’t mean by “positive” the opposite of “negative” but the opposite of “natural.” He said that the idea that things really had natures, reflections of Platonic Forms, was a superstition that originated in religion.

He summarized all human history as passing through three stages: the religious stage, the philosophical stage, and the “positive scientific” stage, which he predicted would soon abolish all religion and all philosophy. He treated this third stage as a new religion, a religion of atheist humanism. He even composed a new atheist liturgy and atheist hymns for his new religion of humanity. My response to those who believe this philosophy is that I think they have too much faith. They’ve been waiting for religion and philosophy to disappear for the better part of two centuries, and they’re still waiting, in faith.

There is no higher law, no natural law, no law of universal human nature by which we can justify or condemn man-made laws. It is, in other words, the repudiation of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the famous first sentence of the American Declaration of Independence.

In this lecture I want to survey nine different forms of Positivism in modern philosophers: methodological, teleological, epistemological, metaphysical, anthropological, ethical, political, logical, and linguistic Positivism. What is common to all nine is the rejection of the belief that the traditional object sought in each of these divisions of philosophy is an objective reality, and the acceptance of the belief that it is subjective rather than objective, posited by the will rather than discovered by the reason. The worldview common to all of these versions of Positivism is a narrowing of the real world. Its news report to us is that Plato’s cave is all there is. There is less in reality than in the mind, not more. If Hamlet had been a Positivist he would have told Horatio that there are fewer things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophies. In a word, Positivism means reductionism: reducing the complex to the simple, the large to the small, the more to the less.

The logical problem with any kind of reductionism is that, while it seems to be skeptical and humble, it’s really the opposite: it’s really very dogmatic and arrogant. For if you claim to know that X is nothing but Y, you are saying that there is in all reality no X that is more than Y; but that means you are claiming to know all of reality. And that’s not a humble or skeptical claim at all. For instance if you claim to know that God is nothing but a myth, you are claiming to know that there is in all reality no God that is anything more than a myth, and that is claiming to know all reality. The word for knowledge of all reality is “omniscience,” and it is by definition a divine attribute. So if you claim to know for sure that there is no God that is not a myth, you are really claiming to be God, and thus there is a God—you—unless you are a mere myth. I don’t mean that as a serious proof for the existence of God, but I do mean it as a demonstration that reductionism is self-contradictory.

He can’t talk about the ultimate meaning and end of history, or temptations from evil spirits, or divine providence or divine judgment or anything like that, even if he believes these things are real.

That’s what he tried to do in this book: define the four common principles of the scientific method in all fields, and then apply it. After he defined the method he gave us three chapters on its application: to ethics, to philosophy and theology, and to physics. He never finished a scientific, purely logical ethics (though Kant claimed to do that one hundred fifty years later) and he only began it in physics, though he promised that if we continued to use it we could literally discover everything that is.

I’d say that the three most important features of the scientific method are: universal doubt, mathematical measurement, and empirical data.

The second principle of the scientific method is measuring everything exactly, quantitatively, mathematically. (That’s the criterion of an exact science.) Reduce quality to quantity. And the third principle is to demand empirical tests, to test all theories by empirical data, not just abstract reasoning. Reduce the abstract to the concrete. Rationalists like Descartes emphasized the second of these points, quasi-mathematical exactness (what Descartes called “clear and distinct ideas,” ideas that were as close to numbers as possible, since every number is totally clear and unambiguous and is also quite distinct from every other number). Empiricists like Bacon and Hobbes emphasized the third point, reducing proof to empirical proof. (2) The new scientific method, methodological Positivism, was a plus for human knowledge.

Rationalism (Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibnitz) reduces knowledge to clear and distinct ideas. Many history of philosophy textbooks classify Plato as a Rationalist, or Descartes as a Platonist. But there is a significant difference: Plato’s ideas are qualitative, not quantitative. Quantitative reasoning is only the third step on Plato’s Divided Line in the Republic. Above this is the knowledge of the Forms, and above even this is the knowledge of the Good, the absolute. So Plato is not a Cartesian kind of Rationalist. Descartes reduces Plato.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 135, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.057813"}

Just as Plato is often classified as a Rationalist, but he really isn’t, by modern standards, so Aristotle, whom I classified as a modified Platonist, is often classified as an Empiricist, but he really isn’t, by modern standards. For Aristotle says that even though all of our knowledge begins with sense experience, it does not end there; it leads to the Forms, by abstraction. All modern Empiricists speak strongly against abstraction and “abstract ideas.” Empiricism reduces Aristotle as Rationalism reduces Plato. The third modern epistemology is Kantianism. It’s usually classified as Idealism, because it maintains that our ideas determine and form reality. Kant insists that he is not an Idealist, but he means by Idealism the teaching that ideas are the only reality, that what seems to be matter is really only mind or ideas. That is metaphysical idealism. Kant is an epistemological Idealist. Kant tried to combine the two kinds of knowing that both Rationalism and Empiricism separated, but he did it not in the way Aristotle did, by abstracting the real Form from the real matter, nor in the way Plato did, by rising from the matter to the Form, but Kant combined the form and the matter by saying that we unconsciously impose the forms on the matter.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 136, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.057814"}

He calls this idea his “Copernican Revolution in philosophy.” These forms included three kinds, for Kant: first, the forms of external sense perception, time and space; second, logical categories like causality, necessity, or relation, and third the three basic “ideas of pure reason,” as he called them, namely God, self, and world. None of these can be known to be objectively real, according to Kant. We cannot know objective reality, or what he calls “things in themselves,” only how it appears to our minds after we have processed it through these three kinds of forms. Plato’s Forms are objective; Kant’s are subjective, though they’re not different for different individuals. They’re universal and necessary but subjective.

But if the most important part of philosophy is metaphysics, as it was for Plato, the most important reductionism is metaphysical reductionism. And the most common, most obvious, most simple, and most radical form of this is materialism, reducing all reality to matter, denying both subjective spirit, or mind, and objective spirit, or Logos , Platonic Ideas. Materialism was a small minority view in ancient times, and simply nonexistent for over one thousand years in the Middle Ages, but increasingly popular in modern philosophy, beginning with Thomas Hobbes in the seventeenth century, and becoming more popular with the “philosophes” of the French Revolution in the eighteenth century, and becoming an ideological dogma for Marx, and for half the world for much of the twentieth century, between 1917 and 1989, the rise and fall of Communism. Materialism is still the working philosophy of the vast majority of popular writers of science in the world. Materialism is the most obvious form of reductionism.

That difference can’t be reduced to brain chemistry because the difference between love and hate is not the same kind of thing as the difference between the presence and absence of serotonin. If you disagree with that, you may know a lot about serotonin but you don’t know much about love. If you think you can get qualities like moral goodness out of mere chemical quantities, you probably think you can get blood out of a stone, or a man out of a machine. (5) And this brings us to anthropological reductionism, our fifth Positivism: reducing human knowers to something not qualitatively different from the universe we know. For the materialist, Man is essentially a machine. La Mettrie, in the seventeenth century, wrote a book with exactly that title, Man a Machine. B. F. Skinner, in the twentieth century, gave a more sophisticated version of that with his Behaviorism. Most thinkers don’t quite go so far as to reduce man to a machine, but they do reduce man to a clever animal, and reduce human reason to the operation of the computer-brain and the rationalization of animal desire.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 139, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.057818"}

Of course, that form of skepticism, like all forms of skepticism, is self-contradictory, for it if is true, it is not true, because if it is true, then there is no such thing as the knowledge of objective truth, only the rationalizing of subjective desire; and if there is no such thing as the knowledge of objective truth, then that idea—that there is no such thing as the knowledge of objective truth—is also not knowledge of objective truth. If all reasoning is nothing but the rationalizing of desire, then the idea that all reasoning is nothing but the rationalizing of desire is also nothing but rationalizing of desires. “Nothing-but” is always self-contradictory. Nothing-buttery always melts itself away. One of the most important aspects or subdivisions of anthropological reductionism is sexual reductionism, which began with Freud.

Freud calls even the affection of a mother for her infant “aim-inhibited affection,” and says that all affection is originally sexual. If Freud actually ever said “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar,” it’s probably only because he was in love with the words “just,” and “only,” and “nothing but.” (6) The most practical, most life-changing division of philosophy is ethics, so the most important Positivistic reductionism is in ethics. For Plato, ethics goes all the way up, so to speak, into ultimate reality, because the ultimate reality is The Good, Values are the highest kinds of facts. There is no absolute fact-value distinction. Ethics is the knowing and living of ultimate Reality. It’s not just obeying laws or satisfying conscience or doing your duty or helping others, it’s also becoming more real, more like ultimate reality, which is Absolute Goodness.

But it’s a “whatever,” it has no content, like the Ten Commandments, for instance. And it’s not teleological; it’s not for any other end, even happiness or human fulfillment. Kantian ethics is called “deontological” ethics because it denies any ontology, any metaphysics, any claim to know objective reality, including the reality of human nature and its needs and its end and perfection and fulfillment, and therefore any law of its nature, any natural laws, as in a natural law ethic.

So the two main options in modern ethics both stem from the rejection of Platonism. (7) And so do the two main options in modern political philosophy—our seventh Positivism. These two options are collectivism, as in Marx, and individualism, as in John Stuart Mill’s Utilitarianism, according to which there is no common good by nature, only by convention and agreement, because there is no universal human nature. Man is not by nature a political animal in most modern political philosophers. And the reason for that is ultimately metaphysics. Modern political philosophy, like modern ethical philosophy, is skeptical of metaphysics, and thus devoid of metaphysical content.

Modern political philosophy has lost faith and hope in knowing the objective essential nature of anything and therefore of the essence and end of man, and therefore of human society. Montesquieu, in The Spirit of the Laws , pits ancient political philosophy, based on the good, or virtue, against modern political philosophy, based on freedom—the freedom to invent and work for any good you want as long as you don’t get in the way of other people doing the same thing—and the modern option wins. John Stuart Mill in the nineteenth century and John Rawls in the twentieth century were the most prominent proponents of this metaphysically content-less politics. It’s a consequence of Kant’s position that we simply cannot know things in themselves, that we can’t know real essences, and therefore we can’t know the essence of man, and therefore we can’t know the essential, natural end and purpose and destiny of man, and therefore we can’t know the universal good of man, and therefore we can’t know the good of human society.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 144, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.057825"}

Even Islam, which has an elaborate, long social tradition, does not base it on philosophy or reason but sheer faith and obedience. Shari’a law is not a natural law but a positive law, posited by God rather than man. (8) Another Positivism in modern philosophy is Logical Positivism. The term was used for a school of thinkers that began with the so-called Vienna Circle in the early twentieth century and which dominated English speaking philosophy for a long time. Its bible was Language, Truth, and Logic by A. J. Ayer.

The majority of philosophers today who call themselves “analytic philosophers” and who concentrate on logical and linguistic analysis, as the Logical Positivists did, no longer hold that extreme view. In fact they explore many questions in metaphysics, ethics, and theology very fruitfully. The reason the movement died was that it is obviously self-eliminating, self-contradictory, because the Verification Principle—taken as a principle, a truth about propositions rather than merely an optional, practical method—contradicts itself. It says that all propositions that are not either tautologies or empirically verifiable are meaningless. But it itself is neither a tautology nor empirically verifiable. Therefore it is meaningless. So this philosophy was later modified from a “this is the way it is” manifesto to a “let’s agree to do philosophy this way” practical method—something like the scientific method aimed at propositions instead of things.

The essential claim of Deconstructionism, as far as I can tell—I keep asking people who say they are Deconstructionists whether they make this claim, because I can’t believe they do, but they all say they really do—the essential claim is that words do not have intentionality : they are not signs of things, and they do not get their truth or even their meaning from real things in the world. According to premodern thought, since there is something like Platonic Ideas, things reflect these Ideas, so that things are also signs, logoi , words. We can look along them as well as at them; we can inquire about their sign ificance. This enquiry is unending and provokes our wonder. According to the modern mind, things are just things, not signs, because there are no Platonic Forms for them to signify. The last step in this reductionism is Deconstructionism. According to Deconstructionism, even words are not words, not signs, they are only things. Archibald MacLeish expressed this nicely in “Ars Poetica” when he said of poetry, “A poem should be palpable and mute / As a globed fruit. . . .

But Existentialism is much broader than Sartre. Existentialism is not a set of answers but a set of questions. There are atheistic and theistic, optimistic and pessimistic, nihilistic and anti-nihilistic Existentialists, but they all ask the same question about human existence: is it vanity of vanities, as the father of Nihilism, the writer of Ecclesiastes, called it? Existentialists are not interested in abstract, theoretical questions, but only in practical, concrete questions, questions that make a difference to human existence. (They use the word “existence,” by the way, to mean only human existence, not the existence of the universe or atoms or bugs or rocks.) Frankly, I find the existentialists the only modern philosophers that are really interesting, for that very reason: they ask the most interesting question, not the questions absent-minded professors ask.

Whether these five things are affirmed or denied makes a difference to one’s life. In fact, they probably make the greatest difference. They make a difference to everything in your life. For instance, take life after death. Whether there is hope of life after death or not, of course you have to put one foot after the other on the way to death, but it makes a difference to each step whether you think the road ends in nothingness or in heaven. You can’t choose to send your body away from that road to the grave, but you can choose to send your soul away in hope. Or you can believe you are reading Dante’s sign over hell: “Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.” You can choose. Not all existentialists affirm life after death, or the soul, or God, or morality, or ultimate meaning, but all of them affirm free choice.

Let’s fast forward through the Middle Ages, the only age in which Nihilism is totally absent, to the beginning of modern times, when the dark sun of Nihilism begins to rise over many horizons. Go to Pascal, the great contemporary, critic and alternative to Descartes, the philosopher of Rationalism and optimism and humanism and the Enlightenment. Pascal was not a Nihilist but he understood Nihilism because he saw it rising in his day, the dawn of modernity, the late scientific Renaissance.

Worse, to cover up our failure, we invent lies. The new lie of our age, which Pascal exposed, was that science can explain everything and technology will make us happy. Pascal, by the way, was one of the greatest scientists of all time. Among other things he invented the world’s first working computer. That’s why a computes language is named after him. A symptom of our unhappiness is boredom. It is a uniquely modern phenomenon; a distinct word for general boredom simply does not exist in any premodern language. War and pain and death do not drive a man crazy; meaninglessness does. Nietzsche said, two centuries later, that a man can endure almost any how if only he has a why.

So all they had left was the leap of faith, and both took the leap, but in opposite directions.

Heidegger claims that traditional metaphysics was based on the mistake of confusing Being itself with a being, an object, a thing, a substance, or at best the mistake of approaching the meaning of Being itself through an exploration of the being of objects or substances, which Plato began and Aristotle developed. All Aristotle’s logical categories apply to beings, but not to being itself, according to Heidegger. He proposed the alternative approach to being itself through an exploration of human be-ing, or human existing, which he called Dasein , being-there, and which he saw as a fundamentally different mode of being than the being of an object. Both objects and conscious subjects participate in being, but in fundamentally different ways. Man is not just the highest object, the rational animal; he is a different mode of being. If we begin with Heidegger, we can summarize Sartre as Heidegger minus Being. There is only what Sartre calls being-for-itself, which is the being of a subject (Heidegger’s Dasein ), and being-in-itself, which is the being of an object; and the two have nothing in common, no common Being to participate in.

Sartre says this atheism is the fundamental principle of his philosophy. He says: “Existentialism is nothing else than an attempt to draw all the consequences of a coherent atheist position.” Sartre’s first premise is atheism, or theological Nihilism, the nothingness of God; and here is its first consequence: it is metaphysical Nihilism, the nothingness of Being. Sartre immediately draws a second consequence, a Nihilism in anthropology: “there is no human nature, since there is no God to conceive it. Man is nothing else than what he makes of himself.” This anthropological Nihilism follows from Sartre’s metaphysical Nihilism. We have existence but no essence. Man exists, but has no meaning, no design, no Logos , since there is no God to design him. He designs himself, and nothing can justify him in designing one meaning or another.

Sartre’s most trenchant critic was Gabriel Marcel, who point by point offered an alternative to Sartre. The best introduction I know to the two essentially different kinds of Existentialism, Sartre’s nihilistic, atheistic, pessimistic version and Marcel’s humanistic, theistic, and optimistic version, is the first two essays in Marcel’s The Philosophy of Existentialism. One of them summarizes Sartre and the other one summarizes the seven basic themes in Marcel’s own philosophy; and the very first theme is that there is Being, and that Being is the Good, or real intrinsic value. This is the heart of Platonism. Marcel, however, approaches this good not by rational argument but by a concrete phenomenological analysis of ordinary human experience. Intrinsic value is not a metaphysical abstraction for Marcel, as it is for Plato, but is incarnated in every person.

In his second chapter Marcel very clearly and fairly explains Sartre’s denial of these basic human values and devastatingly refutes it appealing to experience rather than abstract reason, as Plato did, to answer the immoralists and Sophists of his modern time. I and Thou , by Rabbi Martin Buber, is a poetic version of Marcel’s personalism. Like Marcel’s work it retrieves Logos , real ultimate meaning and value, in a personal rather than a rational and argumentative way, through the encounter of an I with a Thou, a subject-subject rather than subject-object relationship. Marcel and Buber are not household words; but the Personalist philosopher who is almost a household word, who is probably the most famous name among twentieth century philosophers, is Pope John Paul II. He is not easy to read, but he has created a revolution by joining the modern subjective and personalist approach with traditional objective values and natural law thinking as in Thomas Aquinas.

As we emerge from the cave and approach we discover two things: Being and ourselves, the “Am” and the “I” that are equally absolute aspects of the God of the burning bush, or, if you prefer safer philosophical abstractions, of ultimate reality. Augustine, in his Soliloquys , imagines God asking him, “What do you want to know?” And he answers, “Only two things: yourself and myself.” I think that’s wise; that’s it; that’s where it’s at; that’s the whole deal. For those are the only two realities that have eternal and intrinsic and absolute value, and also the only two realities that none of us will ever be able to ignore or escape either in time or in eternity. So we had better get to know them now, and it’s not too late to begin. Isn’t that, ultimately, the reason for studying philosophy? It was for Socrates. I’ve painted a dark picture of Western civilization’s departure from Platonic wisdom during modern times, through its three basic denials of Nominalism, Positivism, and Nihilism.

We’ll seem to go beyond Plato here, but throughout these lectures I have defined Platonism broadly, not just as the logical teaching that universals exist independently, but as the claim of metaphysical transcendence, that reality transcends the cave of ordinary human experience. Let’s begin with the most obvious and universal crack in the cave, death. Death looks like the end: a door into darkness; yet the vast majority of all human beings who have ever lived have believed that it is a new beginning, a door into light, not darkness; up, not down. This is even true today, even in our so-called secular society, especially when people actually approach that door. We then discover our natural instinct to believe, or at least to hope. Platonism becomes very personal when we think about death. This is also true of the question of God. Death makes us ask not just “Is there a God?” but “Will I meet God?” And it is not argument but experience that will answer that question. I use the word “God” here in a broad sense, as a real being superior to us and stronger than death. The two questions, Is there a God? and Is there life after death? are logically related; for only if there is something stronger than death can we hope to experience it after we die.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 178, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.067313"}

That hope strongly motivated even the agnostic Socrates. In his swan song in the Apology , he called this only a hope rather than a proof, although Plato later tried to prove it, both in the Phaedo and in the Republic. Judge for yourself how good the proofs are; I find the strongest proof in the example of Socrates rather than in the arguments of Plato. How can we know what happens at death? We know what happens to bodies at death. They do not go up but down. If they are resurrected in the end, as religious Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe, it can only be by a divine miracle, which is unprovable and unpredictable by mere philosophical reason, but only knowable by religious faith in a divinely revealed promise. But there are good arguments for the soul’s immortality, if only we have souls; for whatever souls are made of, it’s not mortal molecules. Bullets and cancer don’t kill thoughts or loves, only organs. If we’re more than apes plus computers, if we’re persons , then we can hope to live after death. If there are no persons after death, there are no persons before death either, and we are confusing machines with persons. We are only cyborgs, cybernetic organisms, animal-based machines.

Neither apes nor computers philosophize. Even atheists like Freud admit that the belief in the spiritual soul and its immortality is innate, natural to us—though they think it is a natural illusion, like belief in God. Let’s see what that psychological fact entails. The fact is that the vast majority of human beings have believed in both a God and a life after death. If they are wrong, then this vast majority have centered their lives on a fundamental and foundational illusion, and the only people who have been quite sane are the tiny elite minority of unbelievers, almost entirely concentrated in Western Europe and North America and in the last few centuries. I use the word “sane” deliberately. If all supernatural, immortal reality is an illusion, then nearly all of us are as insane as Jimmy Stewart in that old movie Harvey , who believes in an invisible giant rabbit that isn’t there. God is just a bigger Harvey, And life after death and God almost always go together as a package deal. Atheists almost always deny both. My argument is simply that if they’re right, we’re almost all insane; that belief in the sanity of most of the human race is the price you have to pay for denying that death is a door out of the cave.

Death is the biggest door out of the cave, but there are also many little doors, and most of them are little deaths too: death of ordinary consciousness, as in mystical experiences; or death of the ego, as in the saints; or death of control, as in sexual orgasm or in artistic inspiration. There’s a reason to believe that death may be the very best thing that happens to us, because all these other great things that happen to us are little deaths. They look like clues. In Plato’s Phaedo , Socrates told his friends who were already mourning him before he died, “To fear death is to be unwise, because it is to think you know what you do not know: namely, that death is something bad. Who knows that death is not perhaps the very best thing?” It is certainly a hope available to everyone, even in the absence of faith, and a faith available even in the absence of proof. But there is one absolute requirement: the prisoner must what to get out of the cave, and therefore must want there to be a greater world outside the cave, before he will make any effort to find the way to it. There are four steps: desire, hope, faith, proof. Most people don’t get to the fourth step, as Plato did, or thought he did, but almost everyone at least gets to the first step.

In the Symposium , Socrates says that he is willing to join the cycle of speechmaking about love, because, he says, “love is the only thing I claim to know about.” Philosophy itself is a love, the love of wisdom. A second clue is our own hearts. I think this is the single most irrefutable clue of all. Whatever else we mean by the heart—feeling, intuition, willing, choosing—we always mean the power in us that loves, that longs, that desires. Platonism appeals to the heart as well as the head, longing as well as thinking, because it tells us that our hearts’ deepest and most mysterious desire, the desire for a Good that is infinite and eternal and perfect, is a valid clue to truth, that it corresponds to reality. Thus the heart can lead the head. We can raise this from a clue to an argument. Every other innate, natural, and universal desire of our hearts matches a reality; why not this? There is no natural hunger that has no real food. If we’ve learned to trust our hearts, as we learn to trust our mothers, because they’ve delivered on every promise they’ve made to us, why should we believe that this biggest promise of all is a cheat and a lie?

Now this fact that we want to believe it, that we want to believe that Plato and all the religions of the world are right in this essential claim, this good news about there being more, more reality beyond matter, more goodness beyond imperfection, more life beyond death—the fact that it meets our hearts’ deepest longing—why should that fact count against its truth rather than for it? Let’s look at our hearts a little more closely and focus on what we mean by love, since that’s the heart’s work. When Plato speaks of Love, especially in the Phaedrus and the Symposium , he means Eros (desire), not yet Agape (charity).

That would eventually be boring, like ten thousand years in Hawaii. It’s a desire for something we’ve never possessed in this world, which is why we hope for another world. Our lover’s quarrel with the world, our “divine discontent,” our Augustinian “restless heart,” is what Plato means by this Eros. All Eros is for something beautiful, and there are many beautiful things in this world—spiritual beauties like justice and charity and physical beauties like a woman’s face or a snow-covered forest; and we can have these, but we want something more: we want Beauty Itself, the thing all these different beauties come from and lead to. Even when all our other desires are satisfied, our heart still asks the mysterious question: “Is that all there is?” Our Eros is bigger than the sum total of its objects in this world.

This desire is not a proof but it’s a datum, and a clue, and we can look along it as well as at it, we can read it as a sign, like the hands of a clock or a compass needle. Eros is a compass; there must be a magnetic pole. Eros is an arrow: there must be a target.

What built them? Not merely things in this world. Something in the other world did it, through us, not from us. It was crazy divine love igniting crazy human love. It was fire from Heaven. The artist in us responds to these things. Why? Is it an accident? Does this response tell us nothing about our real selves and our real destiny and our real world? This is a powerful clue. I mean our love of beauty, not just of prettiness and satisfaction and harmony, but a beauty the breaks our hearts. This is the profoundest compliment you can ever give to any kind of artist: “you break my heart.” When our hearts are broken with a beauty that shatters us like lightning, this is a strong clue that the lightning really comes from above, as it seems to; and that therefore there is an above, a “more”. These brief storms of living water give a life to our desert-like spirits, a life that we have never known before. How could these thunderstorms really come not from the sky but only from the ground? It’s not a proof. Art doesn’t prove anything. But it sure does sing something. Why not believe the song? Book 10 of Plato’s Republic contains a surprisingly stupid view of art: that it’s only an imitation of nature, and thus two steps removed from ultimate reality, from the Forms.

They don’t imitate nature; they bypass nature and imitate the Forms. They make us see, if only vaguely and uncertainly, through a glass, darkly, something of the paradise of pure Forms lying behind the surface appearances of things. They are a kind of remembrance of Paradise Lost. Some kind of Paradise Lost myth is present in all cultures. It seems to be a kind of collective memory. Remember, in Greek mythology it was the goddess of memory who was the mother of the Muses, the nine inspiring goddesses of all art. In the ancient myths everything in the world we see carries a faint imprint or memory of a world that we do not see; and every hunter and weaver and healer and carver, every practical artist as well as every fine artist, imitates some Archetype, usually concretized in Ancestor. Great art is not only a memory of Paradise Lost but also an anticipation of Paradise Regained; a hint, a hope, an appetizer, of future bliss. The world is like a scrim, a thin semi-transparent screen between the audience and the unseen reality behind the screen. And the artist knows how to light up that screen and show us those imprints. Great artists are like prophets, mediating between two worlds.

For instance, the painting called “The Last Conversation” pictures Jesus and the Thief on the Cross dying together, descending into the darkness, and the central word in that conversation, the very last word, was the word “Paradise.” A seventh door through the walls of the cave is in the stuff of the cave itself, in the power of nature to make us happy. The cave is not just our motel room but our mother. We today insult her by calling her simply “the universe,” but we used to call her Mother Nature, and we used to listen to her songs. She makes us happy by her songs. Why? Have you ever wondered that? Why do stars, oceans, lakes, rivers, trees, mountains, and deserts make us deeply happy? We can’t live in them. We’re not birds or fish or monkeys. We can’t eat them. To use them we have to destroy them, like chopping down trees or damming rivers. But we love these things. We pay big bucks to see them, and vacation among them, and buy property near them. What mystical sugar did the Creator put into these things?

That’s what has such power to make us wise and simple and happy. It’s the same Tao, the same pattern, in three places: in ultimate reality, in nature, and in the wise human life—just as in Plato it’s the same Form in these three places. It’s the Form that unifies man and nature. We sense that; we sense a secret to our own identity in nature because both have the same ultimate origin, like a long lost sister and brother meeting. It’s what Dylan Thomas meant when he wrote “The force that through the green fuse drives the flower / Drives my green age. . . . the force that drives the water through the rocks / Drives my red blood.” Plato wasn’t that kind of mystical romanticist about nature, but what’s common to his vision and the vision of Romanticism is that reality is far greater than appearances; that what we see in nature is just the beautiful scrim. The light comes through it, not from it. There are other clues too, but most of them are rarer. But some of these rare clues are even more convincing, to those who do see them. For instance, there are mystics, and mystical experiences, in every culture. And the great mystics don’t typically seem to be crazy. Was Buddha crazy? Was St. Theresa? Was Lao Tzu? Read them!

I don’t have enough facts to be an unbeliever. From the philosopher’s point of view there’s a lack of clarity and definition about what we see through these holes, what the world outside the cave is composed of, what this Platonic realm means. Evidently, it is something more than abstract and static Platonic Forms (which themselves are much more than mere class concepts, remember). Platonic Forms are just the road map of the country outside the cave, so to speak. And Plato himself knew that Plato was not just a rationalist but also a mystic, and therefore a mythmaker, because he knew that we needed both mythos , concrete sacred story, and Logos , abstract rational understanding; that’s why he ended all his most important dialogs with myths after he went as far as he could with reason. In fact, most of the world’s great teachers, including Jesus, Buddha, and Lao Tzu, taught in parables and analogies more than in definitions and arguments.

What do I mean by that? I mean that the widest and most open door of all is the saints. Anyone can be one. All it takes is the will, the love. Saints are even more convincing than mystics, because they live , not just see , the other world. They are people who love you not merely a little more than most people do; they are people who have a whole other kind of love, a love that is totally self-forgetful, totally fearless of death and pain and suffering and sacrifice, a love that seems to come down from heaven to earth and be willing to go down even more, from earth to death and hell for you. Christians say that you can see the light of Christ shining through the saints, and that light is absolute love. The only force that can resist that love is the force that comes not from earth or nature but from darkness and evil: egotism and jealousy and envy and resentment at goodness. That’s why saints are the most controversial people in the world. They’re not nice. They’re like light; they scare the bugs away. But they’re the most important clue because they tell us what we’re all supposed to be. One of their followers once wrote: “Life contains only one tragedy, in the end: not to have been a saint.” (Leon Bloy) They’re also the most wide-open door because even though not everyone can be a mystic, anyone can be a saint.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 199, "processing_stage": "chunked", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T17:11:39.067352"}

Plato was not a saint. But Socrates was. Erasmus wrote, “Saint Socrates, pray for us.” I second the motion. Socrates was also a martyr. How do you argue with a martyr? How do you argue with something stronger than the fear of death, and thus a powerful clue to something stronger than death? Socrates’s arguments are great, but his example is more unanswerable than his arguments. When I read the Phaedo , I am not satisfied or convinced by Socrates’s three philosophical arguments for the soul’s immortality, profound as they are. But I am totally convinced by Socrates’s death. He is like a Platonic Idea, like a god: unchangeable. Even death does not change him, but only brings out more clearly what is already in him. If you want to be convinced that there is a world outside the cave, if you want to be convinced that there is a world after death, if you want to be convinced of the soul’s immortality, read Socrates’s death scene in the Phaedo.
