First, ever since Pentecost Christians have had to think through the nature of their relationships with others. Christians soon multiplied in number and across an amazing number of racial and social barriers, constituting a church, a fellowship, a body, that transcended the established categories of empire, ethnicity, language, and social status. Even within the pages of the New Testament, Christians are told both to view government as something ordained by God and to view at least one particular government as representative of antichrist. The earliest reported squabbles within the church turned in part on cultural differences, on perceived injustices in the distribution of services to different language groups. Beyond the pages of the New Testament, even a casual knowledge of the history of the church discloses an incredible diversity of situations in which Christians have found themselves: persecuted and reigning, isolated and dominant, ignorant and well educated, highly distinguishable from the surrounding culture and virtually indifferentiable from it, impoverished and wealthy, evangelistically zealous and evangelistically dormant, social reformers and supportive of the social status quo, hungry for heaven and hoping it won’t arrive too soon. All of these polarized possibilities reflect diverse cultural self-understanding. Inevitably, in most generations Christians have pondered what their attitudes ought to be.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D. A.

We find out about Christians in Sierre Leone, the poorest country on earth; we also find out about Christians in Hong Kong and New York City. We watch the church multiplying in Latin America, out in the open, and watch it multiplying in China, in some measure underground. We witness the remarkable loss of Christian consensus almost everywhere in Western Europe, and see the numbers of Christians exploding in the Ukraine and in Romania. We read of Christians being arrested in Iran, beheaded in Saudi Arabia, and butchered by the hundreds of thousands in southern Sudan, while observing the opulence of some Christian surroundings in Dallas and Seoul. We sit with semi-literate brothers and sisters in Christ in a village of Papua New Guinea who are learning to read for the first time, and we cannot forget that their grandparents were headhunters; we sit with presidents of Christian seminaries and universities, responsible for wisely dispensing many tens of millions of dollars every year.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

My own effort in this book begins by summarizing Niebuhr, since Niebuhr has become an icon to which everyone refers, though few today still read him closely. Apart from some initial evaluation of Niebuhr on his own terms, I then try to lay out the rudiments of a responsible biblical theology that any Christian will want to acknowledge, and begin to show how these turning points in the history of redemption must shape Christian thinking about the relationships between Christ and culture (chaps. 1 and 2). The structures generated by such biblical theology are robust enough to allow the many differing emphases within Scripture to find their voices, so that to speak of different “models” of the Christ-and-culture relationship begins to look misleading. Such reflection requires more probing, not only with respect to current debates over “culture” and “postmodernism” ( chap. 3 ), but also with respect to some of the dominant cultural forces of our time ( chap. 4 ).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

But this understanding of “culture” must, sooner or later, be challenged by those who think of “high” culture as a species of elitism, as something intrinsically arrogant or condescending. For them, the opposite of “high culture” is not “low culture” but “popular culture,” with its distinct appeal to democratic values.

Kluckhohn: Culture consists of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups, including their embodiment in artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of traditional (i.e., historically derived and selected) ideas and especially their attached values; culture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products of action, on the other hand as conditioning elements of further action. 1 Culture consists of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired and transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups, including their embodiment in artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of traditional (i.e., historically derived and selected) ideas and especially their attached values; culture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products of action, on the other hand as conditioning elements of further action. 1 Not a few other definitions say something similar.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

The critics offer two dominant arguments. First, they insist, we simply must reject the pretension that a metanarrative is possible: there is no big explanatory story that makes sense of all the little stories. And if we reject the notion of metanarrative, we cannot continue to talk about culture, since culture is bound up with universal or even transcendental assumptions. Second, all such discussions presuppose that we who are discussing culture somehow stand outside it, and that is impossible.

That means the inheritedstatus quoin most Western countries cannot continue unquestioned. We are forced to think through, yet again, what the relationship between Christ and culture ought to be. • The actual history of tensions between church and state varies enormously from state to state in the Western world and beyond, making it difficult to make generalizations, or even discuss examples, without numerous caveats.

In short, Niebuhr wishes to be broadly comprehensive, accepting as “Christ” the various portraits of Jesus Christ found in dominant strands of Christendom. Niebuhr’s approach to what “Christ” means in his title “Christ and Culture” prompts two initial reflections. First, for him, “Christ” is not infinitely plastic. He includes no fundamentalist Arians, for instance, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses; nor does he include the Mormon Jesus. Nevertheless, the sweep of the interpretations of “Christ” that he embraces is doubtless too broad, if one is trying to limit oneself to the forms of confessional Christianity that explicitly and selfconsciously try to live under the authority of Scripture. As a result, certain elements of his understanding of the possibilities of the relationship between Christ and culture should, I think, be ruled out of court, where they are decisively shaped by a frankly sub-biblical grasp of who Christ is. Obviously, I shall have to return to this point. Second, Niebuhr is fully aware that all human understanding is necessarily both partial and interpretative—or, to use the contemporary category, all human knowledge is necessarily perspectival.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Yet he wisely avoids the extreme postmodern position that concludes that knowledge of the objective is impossible. We may say some true things inadequately, even if we cannot say anything adequately, that is, with the knowledge of omniscience, with omniperspective. Despite the calumnies of many postmoderns, Niebuhr is not the only modern who is conscious of human limitations. 17 Turning to what he understands by “culture” (29–39), Niebuhr wants to avoid the technical debates of anthropologists. The culture with which we are concerned, he says, “is not a particular phenomenon but the general one, though the general thing appears only in particular forms, and though a Christian of the West cannot think about the problem save in Western terms” (31).

Again, culture in all its forms and varieties is concerned with the “temporal and material realization of values” (36).

What is becoming obvious is that Niebuhr is not so much talking about the relationship between Christ and culture, as between two sources of authority as they compete within culture, namely Christ (however he is understood within the various paradigms of mainstream Christendom) and every other source of authority divested of Christ (though Niebuhr is thinking primarily of secular or civil authority rather than the authority claimed by competing religions).

This stance is found in the book of Revelation, where it is made all the more acute because Christians are threatened with persecution. But it is also forcefully depicted in 1 John. Despite its profound elaboration of “the doctrine of love” (46)—it is this Epistle which declares, “God is love” (1 John 4:8, 16)—nevertheless “the central interest of the writer … is quite as much the Lordship of Christ as the idea of love” (46). Loyalty to this Christ has entailments in the doctrinal, moral, and social realms. Moreover, “[t]he counterpart of loyalty to Christ and the brothers is the rejection of cultural society; a clear line of separation is drawn between the brotherhood of the children of God and the world” (46–48).

In some detail, he takes us through the later writings of Leo Tolstoy. But Niebuhr insists that all these are merely “illustrations of the type”: one finds similar groups “among Eastern and Western Catholics, orthodox and sectarian Protestants, millenarians and mystics, ancient and medieval and modern Christians” (64). It really does not matter whether these groups understand their own significance in mystical or apocalyptic terms. The type is found equally in monasteries and in a Lutheran Kierkegaard. I suppose that today we would add that this position is also found in Stanley Hauerwas. Niebuhr muses that this position is both “necessary” and “inadequate” (65–76). The stance is often heroic, principled, morally stalwart, and uncompromising.

Niebuhr finds four theological problems with this position. (a) There is a tendency in such radical movements to use “reason” to refer to the methods and content of knowledge within the “culture,” and “revelation” to refer to their own Christian faith.

Jesus stands for the idea of spiritual knowledge; or of logical reason; or of the sense for the infinite; or of the moral law within; or of brotherly love” (109). I suspect that we could add today that Jesus stands for inclusion, for tolerance, for spirituality. Further, these cultural Christians have no firm grasp of “Christian views of sin, of grace and law, and of the Trinity” (112). For instance, they do not grasp how endemic sin is, how it corrupts not only all human beings but all of human nature. Theirs is a moralism that understands little of grace, because it understands little of the need for grace. And God himself easily becomes redefined: “Gnostics need more than a Trinity, liberals less. All along the line the tendency in the movement is to identify Jesus with the immanent divine spirit that works in men” (114).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D. A.

At the heart of this stance is a creedal point: One of the theologically stated convictions with which the church of the center approaches the cultural problem is that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Father Almighty who created heaven and earth. With that formulation it introduces into the discussion about Christ and culture the conception of nature on which all culture is founded, and which is good and rightly ordered by the One to whom Jesus Christ is obedient and with whom he is inseparably united. Where this conviction rules, Christ and the world cannot be simply opposed to each other. Neither can the “world” as culture be simply regarded as the realm of godlessness; since it is at least founded on the “world” as nature, and cannot exist save as it is upheld by the Creator and Governor of nature.

Granted these commonalities, however, there are three groups: the synthesists, the dualists, and the conversionists. At this juncture Niebuhr focuses exclusively on the synthesists. Synthesists seek a “both-and” solution. They maintain the gap between Christ and culture that the cultural Christian never takes seriously and that the radical does not even try to breech—yet they insist that Christ is as sovereign over the culture as over the church. “We cannot say, ‘Either Christ or culture,’ because we are dealing with God in both cases. We must not say, ‘Both Christ and culture,’ as though there were no great distinction between them; but we must say, ‘Both Christ and culture,’ in full awareness of the dual nature of our law, our end, our situation” (122).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

That is also why we are to be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority apart from what God himself has instituted (Romans 13). Synthetic answers were attempted by Justin Martyr. The first great representative of this type, however, is Tertullian’s contemporary, Clement of Alexandria. For instance, in discussing the rich, he can, on the one hand, appeal to great Stoic virtues of thankful generosity, sounding at times like the quintessential cultural Christian. But he goes farther, and gently “issues a clear Christian call to respond to the love of the self-impoverished Lord” (124). Yes, a Christian must be a good person, in accordance with the standards of “a good culture,” but Christ invites people to attain more, and gives them grace to achieve it: love of God for his own sake. “This sort of life is not of this world, and yet the hope of its realization and previsions of its reality fill present experience.” Thus Clement’s Christ “is not against culture, but uses its best products as instruments in his work of bestowing on men what they cannot achieve by their own efforts” (127). But perhaps the most important synthesist is Thomas Aquinas, who “represents a Christianity that has achieved or accepted full social responsibility for all the great institutions” (128).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Yet he manages to combine without confusing “philosophy and theology, state and church, civic and Christian virtues, natural and divine laws, Christ and culture” (130). Niebuhr seeks to demonstrate this in the way in which Thomas “sought to synthesize the ethics of culture with the ethics of the gospel” (130) and in his theory of law (135). No less importantly, “Thomas’ synthesis was not only an intellectual achievement but the philosophical and theological representation of a social unification of Christ and culture” (137). Even though that unification was promptly broken by the stresses of the fourteenth century, and further torn apart by the Reformation and the Renaissance, it marked a comprehensiveness of synthesis one is hard pressed to find again in later times. None of this should be despised: “Man’s search for unity is unconquerable, and the Christian has a special reason for seeking integrity because of his fundamental faith in the God who is One” (141). Others have of course insisted on the importance of social and civil institutions, but what “distinguishes the synthesist of Thomas’ sort is his concern to discover the bases of right in the given, created nature of man and his world” (142).

Although creation is not permitted to overpower redemption, or be overpowered by it, creation is not only the setting for redemption, but the sphere in which God’s sovereign, ordering, work operates. (b) While dualists are sometimes in danger of treating matter, or even human selfhood, as intrinsically evil, with the result that they tend “to think of the institutions of culture as having largely a negative function in a temporal and corrupt world” (193), the conversionist insists the fall is “moral and personal, not physical and metaphysical, though it does have physical consequences” (194). (c) The conversionist adopts “a view of history that holds that to God all things are possible in a history that is fundamentally not a course of merely human events but always a dramatic interaction between God and men” (194).

Without the Logos, nothing has been created; the world that he made is his home. “John could not say more forcefully that whatever is is good.” For this evangelist, “natural birth, eating, drinking, wind, water, and bread and wine are … not only symbols to be employed in dealing with the realities of the life of the spirit but are pregnant with spiritual meaning” (197). The “world” is simultaneously “the totality of creation and especially of humanity as the object of God’s love,” it is “also used to designate mankind in so far as it rejects Christ, lives in darkness, does evil works, is ignorant of the Father, rejoices over the death of the Son” (198). But John does not provide us with any abstract doctrine of sin; rather, he illustrates it, while refusing to define it (199). Within this framework, the gift of God provided through Christ is “eternal life,” but the eschatology of the Fourth Gospel is so realized that this life is substantially enjoyed now, with all that means for all of human existence and culture.

And because their love is rightly placed, all these affections of theirs are right” ( City of God xiv.9, cited on 214). Yet Augustine does not carry this conversionist program to its logical conclusion; he does not “actually look forward with hope to the realization of the great eschatological possibility, demonstrated and promised in the incarnate Christ—the redemption of the created and corrupted human world and the transformation of mankind in all its cultural activity” (215).

Thus we come to Niebuhr’s “Concluding Unscientific Postscript.” We need not follow all of his thought here; it takes us a bit far afield from his own fivefold paradigm. But it is worth picking up two points. First, Niebuhr argues that his study could be extended indefinitely, if it explored a host of other Christian leaders—not only theological thinkers, but a vast array of “political, scientific, literary and military examples of loyalty to Christ in conflict and adjustment to cultural duties.” He is thinking of “Constantine, Charlemagne, Thomas More, Oliver Cromwell and Gladstone, Pascal, Kepler, Newton, Dante, Milton, Blake and Dostoievsky [ sic ], Gustavus Adolphus, Robert E. Lee and ‘Chinese’ Gordon—these and many more.” One marvels at a few names that have been omitted, such as Abraham Kuyper, perhaps, and Abraham Lincoln, Wilberforce, and Shaftesbury. Nevertheless, Niebuhr’s point is that it is impossible to say, “This is the Christian answer” (231). Second, while there is no single theoretical answer, Niebuhr holds that there must be movement “from insight to decision” (233), as each believer reaches his or her own “final” conclusion.

Yet he does not eliminate any branch of “Christian” Gnosticism, nor any wing of “Christian” liberalism. Why not? What these two have in common is their numerical strength during their respective periods of dominance. Is that a sufficient reason to account them Christian? Moreover, Niebuhr has clearly bought into historical reconstructions of these two periods that were rather common in academic circles when he wrote, but which are in fact often (and rightly) called into question. Owing not least to the influence of Walter Bauer, 1 many scholars have come to accept the view that there was no distinction between what we now call orthodoxy and what we now call heterodoxy (or heresy) until well into the second century. In other words, both “orthodoxy” and “heterodoxy” were originally valid options within nascent Christianity.

Full-blown Gnosticism is a second-century development. It is parasitic on first-century theology, rather than coeval with it. Many have responded to Bauer’s book with detailed and penetrating criticism. 3 For instance, noting that Bauer’s title claims to address what takes place in “earliest Christianity,” even though he examines only the second century, I. Howard Marshall opts for the cheeky title, “Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earlier Christianity.” 4 The point to recall is that the New Testament writers themselves distinguish between orthodoxy and heresy, both in early writings (e.g., Galatians 1:8–9; 2 Corinthians 11:3–4) and later writings (e.g., 1 John). And when Gnosticism did develop and grow strong, its theological emphases, though they were in line with a lot of contemporary thought in the broader culture, were far removed from central biblical “givens.” In short, Gnosticism has neither the credentials nor the profile to warrant inclusion in a book of this sort (unless, of course, one is also willing to include Arians, Nestorians, Mormons, and so forth). Similarly for liberal theology, which is one form of what Niebuhr calls “culture Christianity”: transparently, Niebuhr is not talking about what C. S.

If that is what liberal Christianity is, then Machen, though he wrote three-quarters of a century ago, was surely right: liberalism is not another denomination or any other kind of legitimate option within Christianity. Rather, it is another religion. 7 Moreover, although Niebuhr insists that since the eighteenth century Abélard’s followers “have become more numerous, and what was heresy became the new orthodoxy,” 8 his judgment on this matter looks less compelling today. Certainly liberal theology (I continue to use his category) was on the ascendancy during the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries, at least in academic circles, but until the twentieth century it did not capture the majority of people in most denominations. And now, at the beginning of the twenty-first century, classic liberal theology looks more and more outmoded.

And both will be left on the ash pit of history. To digress for a moment, this observation, though defensible, doubtless cries out for more nuance. As Henri Blocher has pointed out, there yet remain many flourishing liberal congregations. 9 More importantly, Blocher points out, when publishers, not least in Europe, seek authors to write manuals of religion or introductions to religious ethics, they almost always approach those in the liberal tradition. Certainly the faculties of theology and religion in universities find their loyalties in that same tradition. Worse, at least one wing of evangelicalism is constantly tempted in this direction.

Classic liberal theologians seek to reshape the elementary components of historic Christian confessionalism to fit into a “contemporary” framework, convinced that this is the only way to preserve all that is good in Christianity. By contrast, many scholars today adopt “liberal” stances, insofar as these stances set aside the turning points in the Bible’s story line, but by and large these contemporary scholars are much more hesitant about insisting on the intrinsic value of the “Christianity” they defend. The classic devout liberal scholar is a gradually dying breed, replaced by a scholar who is no less liberal but much less devout. This is part and parcel of the increased polarization that dominates much Western culture.

It is precisely because the world was made by the Logos that the world’s disowning of the Logos is shown in its ugliest light: “He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him” (1:10).

So Niebuhr’s claim is true, at least at some superficial level. Yet it is misleading: in Niebuhr, the metaphorical use of elements in nature is then quietly linked to realized eschatology, so utterly realized that what Niebuhr wants, in the ideal, is such a transformationist approach to culture that everything gradually gets better by the grace of the gospel. True, John’s Gospel is eschatologically more realized than some other New Testament documents, but his ultimate hope is not in the progressive transformation of the world but in the final cataclysm: Jesus is going away to prepare a place so that his followers may join him (John 14), and when he returns the Son of Man will open the graves of all, precipitating a resurrection to life and a resurrection to condemnation (John 5:28–29).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

And since God is the sovereign Judge, human beings must finally be reconciled to him or be lost. The New Testament Scriptures place similar emphasis on the wrath of God, and insist that the only thing that spares us from destruction under this wrath is the death of God’s own Son. “‘He himself bore our sins’ in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness” (1 Peter 2:24). The alternatives are absolute: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them” (John 3:36). The wretched fact is that we were by nature deserving of wrath (Ephesians 2:3). This wrath is described as “blazing fire,” when Jesus himself “will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord” (2 Thessalonians 1:7–9). Because of the things that constitute us idolaters, “God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient” (Ephesians 5:6).

As the Bible’s story line unfolds, sin’s wretched dimensions become clearer and clearer. Sin can be seen not only as idolatry and as the archetypal hubris, but also as the transgression of law that God lays down. It weaves its own web of corruption and its entailments, as God gives his creatures over to their own desires. Sin is social: although it is first and foremost defiance of God, there is no sin that does not touch the lives of others. Even secret sins of the heart and mind adversely affect others, since by subtly changing me, they change my relations with others. Secretly nurtured lust, for instance, soon affects a man’s or a woman’s relations with the spouse and with other human beings. That is one reason why God’s judgment is poured out on people to the third and fourth generations of those who hate God (Exodus 20:5): sin is social.

Here lies the ultimate “solution” to the strange language of texts like Isaiah 9: the promised one is simultaneously the long-awaited king in David’s line and the one who is rightly called the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. Jesus is not presented merely as the one who brings his Father’s message, the way Muhammad is presented in Islam as the final prophet who brings Allah’s message; rather, in important ways, Jesus is the message, he is the Word, as well as bringing it.

When Jesus inaugurates the long-awaited and long-predicted kingdom, “kingdom” carries diverse weight, depending on the context—or, as the specialists put it, “kingdom” becomes a tensive symbol that is decisively shaped by the surrounding contexts. Often “the kingdom of God” is best thought of as “the reign of God,” for “kingdom” is far more commonly dynamic than static, rather more “kingdominion” or “reign” than “kingdom.” In the New Testament, the kingdom comes with the baby who is born a king (Matthew 2). It also comes with the onset of Jesus’ public ministry and the announcement of the dawning of the kingdom. It is displayed in the miracles and preaching of Jesus’ disciples (Luke 10:1–24). In Jesus’ parables, it can embrace good and evil, encompassing God’s providential sovereignty, extending so far that it is the context in which both the wheat and the weeds grow (Mark 4); alternatively, it is highly restricted and becomes that subset of God’s dynamic reign under which there is eternal life (John 3:3, 5).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Moreover, within the much larger framework of the canon, Jesus’ death is tightly bound up with his “fulfillment” of the Old Testament sacrifices (especially those of Passover and Yom Kip-pur), and his resurrection vindicates him. Jesus himself understands his death to provide a ransom for many (Mark 10:45; Matthew 20:28); his words of institution at the last supper demonstrate that he understands his death, the shedding of his blood and the breaking of his body, to be the ground of the remission of sins, as well as the inauguration of the new covenant. Small wonder that the apostle Paul insists his practice is to focus his preaching on the cross (1 Corinthians 2:1–5), which he understands as God’s design to cancel sin and absorb the wrath, in the person of God’s Son, that should have come to us (Romans 3:21–26). In similar vein, the apostle Peter sees in the cross both the model of self-sacrificing service to others, and the unique sacrifice in which Christ bore our sins in his own body on the cross(1Peter 2:24).It takes an effort of will to hear the power of such claims today, because the phrases are so well known that they trip off our tongues and dance through our memories.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

The context is important. As a trap, some Pharisees and Herodians, in a strange mixing of bedfellows, ask Jesus whether or not it is lawful to pay the imperial tax to Caesar. If he replies in the affirmative, he risks alienating many in his Jewish audience, not only because they detested the Roman superpower, but also because the Emperor, whose image was on the coin, was worshiped as in some sense divine. If the coin by which this tax was paid was the denarius, it would have borne the head of Tiberius, the reigning Caesar, along with the words, in Latin, “Tiberius Augustus Caesar, Son of the Divine Augustus” (TI CAESAR DIVI AVG F AVGVSTVS). To approve payment of such a tax, to such a lord, in such a medium, seemed tantamount to idolatry. On the other hand, if Jesus replies in the negative, he can be charged, by the Romans themselves, with inciting insurrection. Jesus responds by asking for the relevant coin to be brought to him. He holds it up and asks the question, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” Inevitably, they respond with “Caesar’s.” That is when Jesus utters his famous dictum: “Give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” At one level, then, Jesus’ reply was a brilliant maneuver by which he evaded the trap and left his opponents speechless.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

The first will be most clearly perceived when we recall that up to that point in history, religion and state were everywhere intertwined. This was true, of course, of ancient Israel: at least in theory, Israel was (as we have seen) a theocracy. Similarly in the pagan world: most of the gods of the people were necessarily the gods of the state. When the Romans took over some new territory, they arranged a god-swap: they adopted some of the local gods into their own pantheon and insisted that the locals take on some of the Roman gods. This had the effect of breaking down local allegiance to gods that were peculiarly theirs. If rebellion erupted, it would be less than clear on whose side the various gods were fighting. But nowhere was there a state that was divorced from all gods, what we would call a secular state, with state and religion occupying distinct, even if overlapping, spheres. But on the face of it, that is what Jesus is advocating. At very least, insofar as he envisages a transnational and transcultural community that is not identified with any one state, he anticipates the obligation to give to the Caesar that is in power whatever is his due.

Moreover, this way of looking at things is one of the most important features that differentiates Christianity and Islam. Islam has no body of tradition that enables it to distinguish between church and state. Indeed, the ummah, the people themselves, bound up with allegiance to Allah, are, in theory at least, more important than any state. But the state’s role, finally, is to bow to the law of Allah. Yet we must not think that Jesus’ utterance warrants an absolute dichotomy between God and Caesar, or between church and state, or between Christ and culture. That brings up the second detail in the text that must be observed. When Jesus asks the question, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” biblically informed people will remember that all human beings have been made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26). Moreover, his people have the “inscription” of God’s law written on them (cf. Exodus 13:9; Proverbs 7:3; Isaiah 44:5; Jeremiah 31:33). If we give back to God what has his image on it, we must all give ourselves to him. 28 Far from privatizing God’s claim, that is, the claim of religion, Jesus’ famous utterance means that God always trumps Caesar.

How could they? They are God’s servants (13:4); the authorities that exist have been established by God (13:1). Recognition of this point brings us to complex discussions about the nature of divine Providence, a discussion that must await later chapters. At this juncture, however, we recognize that with the coming of Jesus and the gospel, although Jesus himself has introduced a distinction between the authority of Caesar and the authority of God, related in part to the political reality that the locus of the people of God is not Caesar’s state, or any other state, nevertheless Jesus does not concede that God and Caesar are parallel authorities.

To put the matter in a speculative, “what if” sort of way, would Tertullian have argued in exactly the same way if he had been transported to Rome in A.D. 325, or to Paris in 2005? In other words, is it not the part of wisdom to commend a more holistic reflection on the relations between Christ and culture, even while recognizing that certain elements in these relations may need special emphasis in concrete existential circumstances? In short, it appears that some, and perhaps all, of Niebuhr’s five patterns need to be trimmed in some way, by reflection on the broader realities of biblical-theological developments.

But by seeking to integrate all the non-negotiables of biblical theology into our reflections on these matters, and by observing different ways in which the vocabulary is sometimes used, we may wonder if the discrete patterns that Niebuhr lays out are sometimes so stylized as to mask the more foundational and undergirding biblical assumptions about Christ and culture.

In his mercy, God leaves traces of himself and his ways in every culture. That is the point of some popular missiological accounts, such as Don Richardson’s well-known Peace Child: 31 there are elements in any culture to which the gospel may legitimately appeal, even if (and here we leave Niebuhr behind) the adoption of the gospel will inevitably transform that culture in important ways. (2) An analogy may help clarify this first point. Some theologians have identified different “models” of atonement theory that have been constructed across the history of the church, and have sought to ground each within the New Testament: the moral governance theory, for instance, or the substitutionary atonement theory, and so on. But this is methodologically flawed. When some historical figures have sought to propound one “model” of the atonement at the expense of another, as we earlier witnessed with Abélard, there has usually been a larger theological agenda operating.

This tension is bound up with the different ways the New Testament speaks of God’s reign. Christ reigns over all, including things Christian, non-Christian, and anti-Christian. When we contemplate Christ’s reign in this sweeping sense, we are focusing on the mystery of providence, rather than his rule over people who have submitted themselves to his reign, since much of culture contests his authority and does not submit to his revelation. Much of culture claims it is free from his voice, or, at the very least, enjoys freedom to choose or reject what it wills from his voice. Nevertheless, from a biblical perspective Christ must reign, with all authority, until he has put the last enemy under his feet, death itself. Whether contested or even denied, this authority operates to bring about God’s plans.

But since the time of Ferdinand de Saussure, linguists have distinguished between langue and parole. This is roughly the distinction between competence and performance. A parrot may be said to be speaking French; it would be misleading to say that a parrot is a French speaker. A person learns, say, English, and thus is said to be an English speaker (langue), but the English he or she speaks is not English in the abstract, or the totality of all that goes by “English.” The language spoken by an individual may be said to be English (langue), but what is actually spoken is the performance of that individual (parole). One of the things that has long interested linguists is the relation between langue and parole.

Far from it: indeed, many such assertions constitute the fulcrum on which the most barbaric forms of racism, colonialism, and unrestrained nationalism turn. Six observations may bring some clarity.

If that unity was so bad, then perhaps the diversity is itself a good thing. At the very least, even though the imposition of the diversity of languages was a rebuke and a restraint, it is not transparently clear whether the multiplicity of languages in itself was a good or bad thing. It was good in that it broke up this cabal of rebellion; it was bad in that it led to disjunctive groups (tribes? nations? races?) that were often at enmity with one another.

One could engage in similar musings with respect to fragmentation. But it is difficult to see why either fragmentation or multiculturalism, however understood, threatens Niebuhr’s analysis. Every culture keeps changing. Changes can be brought about by an almost infinite array of factors: fresh immigration, international events, economic trends, educational trends, the popularity of various political and economic ideas, developments in the media, pop entertainment, whether the people of that culture live their lives in a time of peace or a time of war, and much more. Inevitably, some groups within the broader culture will react to such changes in different ways. Some, for instance, may be delighted by the influx of new immigrants; others may resent them in some ways but lust for the cheap labor they represent; still others, driven perhaps by xenophobia, ascribe all fresh ills to the newcomers.

I shall return to these questions in the last two chapters. Three kinds of issues must be addressed here; the broader challenge of postmodernism I will take up again in a few pages. First, that stance is most likely to be deeply Christian which attempts to integrate all the major biblically determined turning points in the history of redemption: creation, fall, the call of Abraham, the exodus and the giving of the law, the rise of the monarchy and the rise of the prophets, the exile, the incarnation, the ministry and death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the onset of the kingdom of God, the coming of the Spirit and the consequent ongoing eschatological tension between the “already” and the “not yet,” the return of Christ and the prospect of a new heaven and a new earth.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

But it is easy to see how downplaying these turning points can introduce other massive distortions into one’s understanding of cultures and therefore of how to interact with them. For example, if creation is ignored, it becomes easy to develop a quasi-gnostic view of salvation and much more difficult to grasp that human responsibility is fundamentally grounded in the fact that we owe everything to our Creator. What is lost is a sense of indebtedness. Equally sad, people might be tempted to a purely non-corporeal vision of “salvation,” with devilish consequences in the physical world. Or again, if the fall is minimized, including the way that it is developed across the canon, sin is diminished. Worse, the fundamental nature of idolatry—the de-godding of God, the desperate failure to love God with heart and soul and mind and strength—fades into a ghostly image of itself, and this in turn dissolves one of the most central and controlling aspects of salvation described in the Bible, namely, being reconciled to God on God’s terms.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Failure to integrate, say, the exodus and the giving of the law robs us of the great Old Testament paradigm of liberation, of God-revealed norms, of a notion of holiness tied simultaneously to God and to the maintenance of what God has prescribed and proscribed, of the tension between being saved from something and being saved for something, of a people peculiarly belonging to God, of an entire covenantal structure that turns on a tabernacle/temple, a priesthood, a sacrificial system—all of which are taken up and modified in various ways in the New Testament.

The “real point” of Genesis 3 is to provide an explanation of death’s origins, of the difficulties intrinsic to birth and work—and this, not as a function of “real” rebellion, but in the context of his own critical assessment of how etiological tales arise. 20 Pannenberg’s approach to Genesis 3 is compounded when he links “uncompleted” and “unredeemed,” when he treats evil primarily as “risk” entailed by human independence, which is the “condition of [God’s] purpose for the creature,” and when his theodicy is entirely eschatological. 21 Because he is a systematician, at least Pannenberg is trying to paint a coherent picture, even if it is one that is rather farther removed from the context of the Pentateuch, not to say from Paul (see especially Romans 5:12–21; 1 Corinthians 15:21–22, 45–49), than he thinks.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

This springs in part from the fact that in France, postmodernism was tightly connected with certain literary and critical readings of texts, which readings are no longer in vogue, but never gained control of the philosophical schools: the analytic tradition of philosophy, regnant in much of Europe, never succumbed to postmodernism’s reductionisms. Further, the influence of François Lyotard, who taught his readers to be deeply suspicious of all “big pictures” or “metanarratives,” made it inconsistent to speak of postmodern ism, any more than of any other “ism.” A very recent French work, written by an able philosopher, can speak of “postmodernity ” as a phenomenon, 27 but certainly not of “postmodern ism. ” By contrast, postmodernism in America has become a sloganeering word that touches almost every human domain.

A chastened or modest modernism pursues the truth but recognizes how much we humans do not know, how often we change our minds, and some of the factors that go into our claims to knowledge. A chastened postmodernism heartily recognizes that we cannot avoid seeing things from a certain perspective (we are all perspectivalists, even if perspectivalists can be divided into those who admit it and those who don’t) but acknowledges that there is a reality out there that we human beings can know, even if we cannot know it exhaustively or perfectly, but only from our own perspective. We tend to sidle up to the truth, to approach it asymptotically—but it remains self-refuting to claim to know truly that we cannot know the truth. 36 To set such a modest modernism and such a chastened postmodernism side-by-side is to see how much alike they are. They merely put emphases in different places. In fact, though they do not always recognize it themselves, there are writers who think of themselves as moderate foundationalists and others who think of themselves as cautious postfoundationalists who are approaching this center from opposite sides.

The biblical story line, which finally centers on the gospel of Jesus Christ, establishes the summum bonum, the highest good, the thing we actively cherish and pursue. That is why John can speak both of believing the truth and of doing it. But to argue, with Raschke, that in this postmodern age we need to go “beyond” worldviews into a stance in which we admit God is so Wholly Other that we can receive him only by faith, and that this response is entirely in line with the Reformation’s insistence on sola fide, 53 is confused at several levels. In particular, once again it has distorted “worldview” into something unrecognizable by any side in the discussion.

Trust in God, fostered and nurtured by the power of the Spirit, is grounded not so much in what is unknown about him but in what he has disclosed of himself—not only in supernatural acts, the chief of which is the resurrection of Jesus, but in words of promise and instruction, which are to be believed and acted upon. Raschke’s view of faith has more in common with Bultmannian existentialism 54 than with the Reformation, let alone with the New Testament. Perhaps this is the place to point out that the postmodern penchant for affirming the unknowability or the incomprehensibility of God, often with pious reference to Calvin’s affirmation of the doctrine, habitually overlooks some fundamental distinctions. In particular, there is an enormous chasm between what Calvin means by “God is incomprehensible” and what Kant means by “God is incomprehensible.” For Calvin, God extends immeasurably beyond what human beings may know, but that does not mean that human beings may not know any true things about him, the more so since this God has graciously chosen to reveal to his image bearers some true things about himself.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Moreover, even though we regularly speak of God in analogical language, some elementary distinctions steer us around some avoidable pitfalls. 56 One can say true things by means of a metaphor. 57 Further, if Scripture necessarily deploys analogy to refer to much of what God has disclosed of himself in Scripture, it is useful to distinguish between univocal analogy and equivocal analogy. Thus a statement such as “God exists” is not, for Christians, a metaphorical statement (i.e., it is not a product of human creativity), but a univocal analogical assertion: the spiritual being “God” can be said to “exist” in many of the same ways that we say that we ourselves “exist.” The statement “God is our heavenly Father” is, by contrast, an equivocal analogical statement: that is, although God is not univocally what we mean by “father,” yet mutatis mutandis (“equivocally”) God is the “heavenly Father” to those who are his children.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Nevertheless, Lyotard contends, these grand stories have no independent status; they are themselves the product of certain people and cultures. “Lyotard very specifically defines metanarratives as universal discourses of legitimation that mask their own particularity; that is, metanarratives deny their narrative ground even as they proceed on it as a basis…[T]he problem with metanarratives is that they do not own up to their own mythic ground.

Postmodernism wishes to overthrow the universalizing pretensions of modernism. All of this, Smith contends, is a very good thing for the gospel. It is reminiscent of Francis Schaeffer and Cornelius Van Til. Lyotard was not trying to overturn Christianity; he was trying to overturn modernism, and Christians should be grateful for his effort.

In fact, Smith acknowledges that Christian thinkers such as Middleton and Walsh, Grenz, Ingraffia, and others detect in Lyotard a very considerable danger for Christian claims. But Smith judges that these thinkers are worrying about nothing, because “the biblical narrative is not properly a metanarrative” (69).

Certainly popular writers like McLaren are now so suspicious of metanarrative in some comprehensive sense that they refuse to present Christ’s claims as grounded in the sweeping story line of Scripture.

Foucault’s studies of institutions of power—prisons, schools, hospitals, and factories—taught him that “power is knowledge.” At the heart of all such institutions, and no less at the heart of sexual and financial relationships, are networks of power. Much in line with Nietzsche, Foucault insists that only one drama is ever played out, “the endlessly repeated play of dominations.” 64 Foucault seems to have become less Nietzschean with time, almost (it appears) returning to a classic liberal or Enlightenment position, and Smith carefully draws attention to the debate among Foucauldian scholars as to who the real Foucault is.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

We must see the evils that Foucault sees—Smith himself primarily applies Foucault to capitalism—and yet reject Foucault’s warnings against all forms of “disciplinary society.” Rather, precisely because God does exercise authority, God’s people must form disciplinary societies that are able to stand up and pull away from the seductive and destructive attractions of, say, MTV. Certainly the need for godly discipline, empowered by the Spirit of God, is very great. But of course, Foucault himself makes no exceptions for God. Elsewhere Foucault explicitly ties everything that he finds wrong with the exercise of power to what he understands of Christian institutions. In other words, despite the fact that Smith wants postmodern Christians to learn something valuable from Foucault, even he has to admit that Christians must go directly counter to Foucault when it comes to Christian discipline and the exercise of power intrinsic to it.

If the postmodern theologian knows that such certainty is impossible, he or she must know it certainly. But that means certain knowledge is not impossible after all. On the other hand, if the postmodern theologian merely misspoke, and merely believes that such certainty is impossible, then perhaps he or she is mistaken.

In other words, if Smith had exposed the internal incoherence of the archetypal postmodern theologian he is discussing, instead of adopting this rejection of “the Cartesian paradigm,” he would have found it far more difficult to make his next moves toward Radical Orthodoxy.

In fact, a substantial number of “soft” postmoderns avoid this pitfall the way they would an E. coli infection. But once we acknowledge that many moderns seek “certainty” in relative terms only and distance themselves dramatically from implicit claims to omniscience, then the polarity that drives Smith’s argument breaks down.

After his resurrection, Jesus “presented himself to [his disciples] and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive” (Acts 1:3). Of course, many biblical writers also stress the crucial importance of faith. My point is that they can talk about faith and truth, about believing and knowing. Clearly this knowing is not the knowledge of omniscience; the “certainty” that Luke wants Theophilus to enjoy is not the certainty that belongs to God alone.

But Paul insists that it must be a true witness, that is, that the report must conform to reality, or else the witnesses are liars. The truth of Jesus’ resurrection, then, is “objective” in the sense that it takes place out there, in space/time history, in the real world, even if human beings can never claim epistemological objectivity of the sort that belongs only to Omniscience.

In Hebrews, faith includes the element of perseverance (see how strong that element is in Hebrews 11, for instance). But without exception, faith is invalidated if its object is untrustworthy, or, where ostensible facts are concerned, if the object of faith is not true. The Bible never encourages us to put our faith in what may or may not be true. (d) It follows that if we believe something that is not true, “we are to be pitied more than all others” (15:19). In other words, Paul does not think faith is virtuous because those who exercise the faith are sincere or devout. Faith without a true object, Paul asserts, is pitiful. In much of the Western world, however, faith is not at all tied to the truthfulness or reliability of its object. Faith is little more than personal, subjective, religious preference.

I suppose we might say that there are ambiguous elements in faith in that we trust God and his Word even where we cannot clearly see the way ahead. But the point to observe is that in the Bible it is right to trust this God with the future, not because of what we do not see or know, but because of what we have come to know of this God—including such truth as the fact that God raised his own dear Son from the dead for our justification. Faith enables us to have confidence in God where we do not see, because it is grounded in the immutable character of God that we have come by grace to perceive as utterly reliable. Smith does not work this out, for he is too busy trying to distinguish faith from knowing, introducing a polarity utterly unknown in Scripture. When Augustine writes, “I believe, therefore I understand,” he thinks of faith in a biblical sense, not in Smith’s slightly woolly sense, still less in the street sense of much Western subjectivism.

In more popular parlance, however, all three words—“secular,” “secularization,” and “secularism”—have to do with the squeezing of the religious to the periphery of life. More precisely, secularization is the process that progressively removes religion from the public arena and reduces it to the private realm; secularism is the stance that endorses and promotes such a process. 2 Religion may be ever so important to the individual, and few secular persons will object. But if religion makes any claims regarding policy in the public arena, it is viewed as a threat, and intolerant as well. In reality, the social pressures of secularization are far more unrelenting than this simple distinction between private religion and public religion suggests.

Its freedoms, so many of which are enormously praiseworthy for political, religious, personal, and artistic reasons, include the freedom to be hedonists, to pursue a life revolving around entertainment, to become inured against responsible family life, communal interaction, and self-denying service in the endless worship of massive egos, passing fads, and this-worldly glitter.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Christians with a firm grasp of the Bible’s story line from creation to consummation, even while they offer thanks for the freedoms that democracy provides, will not overlook the fact that democracy, rule by the people, what we might call the kingdominion of the people, cannot compete for righteousness with the kingdominion of God. History coughs up many examples where democracy cannot be counted on to do the right thing: one need go no further than Weimar Germany. Taking into account what the Bible says about the moral accountability of people and nations alike, we may sometimes wonder how long it will be before God calls to account some of the major democracies of the West, as he has done by war and plague in the past, as he has done with respect to every civilization in the past. For this remains God’s world, a world in which righteousness exalts a nation, while sin condemns any people (Proverbs 14:34). Even while Christians are being tugged, by Scripture itself, to being good citizens, not least within a democracy, their ultimate citizenship, and thus their ultimate loyalty, lies elsewhere (Hebrews 13:14).

We have already seen how the lure of secularization is inescapably tied to the mystique of (especially Western) democracy. Democracy is also irrefragably tied to notions of freedom. Yet freedom is far more than a political category. One may be “free” from the constraints of the state, but one may also be “free” from traditions, free from God, free from morality, free from inhibitions, free from oppressive parents, free from wise parents, free from assignments of various kinds, free from sin, and much more. Americans like to think of themselves as inhabiting “the land of the free,” and thus are inclined to assign freedom or liberty to the very highest rank among the virtues. “Live free or die,” one state slogan puts it. It is hard to imagine any state with the slogan, “Be holy or die”—so once again, without for a moment disavowing the many ways in which Christians want to embrace freedom, it is easy to uncover ways in which the worship of freedom may actually displace the worship of God. Christ and culture may at some points share common perspectives, but it is not hard to see how they are likely to clash. We must probe a little more deeply into the nature of freedom from state coercion.

This judgment is grounded in the assumption that theological considerations cannot be admitted into the reasonings of any voters: in other words, religion is private, the values of secularism are unquestioned, and those who challenge this stance are not democrats at all. Worse, in the mind of leaders of the left, what is being destroyed is their freedoms, and thus their vision of America. This stance is not universal on the left, of course, but it is surprisingly common. Consider Amy Gutmann’s recent book. 30 At first, Gutmann appears to understand the problem: she criticizes liberals for demanding too much freedom and for allowing too little for those who disagree with them.

To her credit, Gutmann recognizes the problem. She wants a form of liberalism, she says, in which liberals do not defend mere atomistic individualism but understand full well that individuals usually flourish in the context of private associations, “identity groups” (hence the title of her book), including churches. Moreover, liberals should not merely put up with these identity groups in some concessive fashion: they must heartily endorse freedom of association. So far so good. But Gutmann treats all associations—churches, drama groups, NAACP, even groups identified by such words as “geek, jock, bimbo, and hottie,” as nothing more than the result of individual choices. These identity groups are fluid and changing, little more than the contexts of individual freedom of choice. Thus the primacy of individual freedom of choice is front-loaded into the discussion.

If gays insist on their right to membership in the Boy Scouts, or feminists insist that they have equal rights of participation in the leadership of Orthodox Jewish life, then government has both the right and the obligation to force these groups to comply. If many members of these groups feel that their rights and freedoms are thereby being trampled into the mud of the liberal-egalitarian vision, that’s their problem: their views cannot be allowed to supersede “democratic justice” and “civic equality.” It is deeply troubling to discover that Gutmann does not even see the problem.

Journalists who love to criticize those who are “in power” are of course exercising their own form of power as they do so. Much as we sometimes dislike the way the power of the media is dispensed, most of us who have lived the better part of our lives in countries with a free press would hate to see that freedom taken away, for the reduction of the power of the fourth estate sooner or later results in unchecked power in the state itself.

As necessary as the media are to preserve a relatively free society, the lust for power—spelled out in money, influence, exposure, high-profile jobs—is so intense that it frequently blinds those who hold these jobs as to the nature of their calling and thus to the importance of truth and integrity. Of course, both good and bad motives may also characterize those who exercise power in the name of Christ. The lust to be “first,” to be Number One, did not die out with Diotrephes (3 John 9). Having rejected the authority of the pope, many a Protestant pastor exercises papal-like authority in his much smaller fiefdom.

Moreover, not every minister of the gospel is hungry for power in some improper sense. The example of Christ is a constant constraint on those with sensitive consciences: the Master was the perfect suffering Servant, but he was also the one who cleared the temple precincts by overturning the tables of the money changers and driving out their animals with a whip. As Richard John Neuhaus never tires of telling us, one does not have to choose between being a thug or a wimp. However falteringly, we try to learn when it is right to suffer abuse and love those who persecute us, very much like the Master himself, and when it is right to clear the temple, very much like the Master himself. Thus the very nature of the gospel message, centered as it is in the obscenity of the cross, has a curtailing effect on the lust for power, as long as the gospel itself is prized above all things.

The list of troubling expressions includes “religion,” “church,” “state,” “nation,” “faith,” “society,” and several others I have already probed somewhat in this book, including the words “faith” and “culture.” So a little unpacking seems to be in order. Today we commonly think of religion as a particular system of ultimate values in which the pursuit of the ideal life is embodied. The assumption of such a quest necessarily challenges the status quo. This assumption arises most clearly in Christianity and in substance in the Judaism out of which Christianity sprang. But such a quest was very much at odds with surrounding “religions” in the first century, which focused on sacred rites and cultic observance, on preservation and conservation of ancient traditions. The influence of Christianity and the rise of multiculturalism have together encouraged other “religions” to become quests.

To do so gives the impression either that Christianity was primarily cultic and conserving instead of questing and transforming, or that all the ancient pagan religions were, like Christianity, interested in the pursuit of the ideal life, eager for ethical and spiritual transformation, and living with eternity’s values in view. 1 Although many English translations of the New Testament use the word “religion” at some point or other, there is no Greek or Latin word in the first century that means exactly what “religion” means in the twenty-first century.

To compound the problem of word meanings, many contemporary Christians, following the example of Western culture at large, increasingly use “religion” in an entirely pejorative sense.

When Americans speak of “the wall of separation” between church and state, do they really imagine a wall of separation between the church as an institution and the state, or between Christians and the state? My third example is a couple of contemporary churches, both in major urban centers, belonging to two different denominations. Both churches are known for the excellence of their expository, Bible-teaching ministry; both have congregations that are growing rapidly, mostly by conversion, with an average age in the low 30s. Both insist on distinguishing between the forms of ministry and service in which the church as a church engages and the forms of ministry and service in which Christians belonging to those churches engage.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

For instance, for a Japanese citizen to engage in something treasonous is horribly shameful, for Japan is a tightly knit “nation,” not a melting pot of peoples. Add to this a shame culture, and treason seems horribly vile. Again, in the heyday of the British Empire, it was particularly reprehensible to act in a way that would knowingly harm the Empire. By contrast, where a state delights in its rollicking diversity, treason itself becomes democratized. 8 There is no “big idea” by which everything must be tested. In America, prosecutors may zealously go after those who have engaged in treason, but the media are never outraged. Rather, they are intrigued, sometimes even vaguely admiring. (2) The Roman Empire of the first century certainly falls into the “empire” category of Werner’s analysis, but it was nevertheless characterized by a number of polarities that are relevant to our discussion.

In the religious realm, Rome, as we saw in the second chapter, arranged god-swaps when it took over fresh territory: it insisted that the local people adopt some of the gods in the Roman pantheon while Rome itself adopted some of the local gods into its own pantheon.

Above all, these tendencies meant that Rome was (d) simultaneously tolerant and intolerant, syncretistic and exclusivistic. 9 Pluralism and tolerance triumphed as long as no religion claimed exclusive truth or threatened the imperial order. The gods were bound up with the social order; they were tied in complex webs of relationships with people, land, leaders, elites, and the emperor himself.

The change to the nation-state is nowhere better typified than in Bismarck and the founding of modern Germany. Nevertheless, the tension between “nation” and “state” within the “nation-state” runs forward into more recent centuries. Hitler’s National Socialism played with the notion of the German people, the German nation— as easily Volk as Nation— who somehow needed and deserved to be governed by one leader and constitute one nation-state. Only a few weeks ago Can ada’s Parliament granted the category “nation” to Québec. The word “nation” is a little more ambiguous in French than it now is in English, and it might in this context mean nothing more than the recognition of a culturally distinctive people. Certainly that is what Prime Minister Harper had in mind, for his final edit of the bill that recognized Québec as a “nation” added the words “within a united Canada.” Not surprisingly, now that Québec may call itself a “nation,” some of the séparatistes want more of the trappings of a “nation” in the political sense, including the ability to conduct their own foreign affairs.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution says, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.” Although the matter is disputed, “an establishment of religion” probably had in view, at the time, the fact that some states had an “established” religion: Connecticut, for instance, was tied to the Congregational Church. Congress was not to meddle in such matters, which had the effect of leaving an established church in some states, and leaving other states without an established church, as the states themselves preferred.

Thus Massachusetts and Virginia headed in different directions, and according to the Bill of Rights (which included the First Amendment), ratified in September 1789 (note the later date!), Congress was not to interfere. In the bitter election of 1800, Jefferson, whose radical biblical criticism and whose romantic Deism made him anathema to many conservative Christians, nevertheless won the support of some conservative Christians who cherished religious liberty. 27 After receiving a letter from the Baptist Association of Danbury, Connecticut (where, of course, their own religious affiliation was not part of the establishment), congratulating him on his victory and applauding him for his defense of religious liberty, President Jefferson responded on New Year’s Day, 1802.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

United States), though probably it played little if any role in the decision. The climax came in the landmark case Everson v. Board of Education (1947), in which Justice Hugo L.

Christians and non-Christians alike can make use of the goods in this autonomous secular realm, even if they do so with a “different faith” and “different hope.” In fairness to Markus, it is important to observe how carefully he distinguishes this secular sphere from contemporary secular liberalism. Augustine’s secular sphere, Markus argues, unlike secular liberalism, is devoid of moral categories. It is bound up only with meeting material needs, with establishing order and security. The very recent work by Kristen Deede Johnson 33 appeals to Augustine in a slightly different way. The heritage of liberal democracy has taught people to rank tolerance among the highest of the virtues, while what she calls “post-Nietzschean celebration of difference” 34 sets such a premium on difference that the result is incompatible with liberal democracy. The way ahead, Johnson avers, is beyond tolerance and difference (hence her subtitle): we learn from Augustine that there is no ultimate harmonization of differences until the coming of the Heavenly City.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

(b) A recent book by Jeffrey Stout 36 attempts a similar but slightly different mediating position. He insists that liberal secularists think of themselves as administrators or arbiters of the public sphere, while in fact they are simultaneously one of the parties in that sphere—a point they regularly overlook. They are one of the participants in political conversation, not the framers and still less the judges of that conversation.

Yet the thrust of the book is more sympathetic to liberal democracy (which pretty soon becomes, in Stout’s usage, indistinguishable from liberal secularism) in general and to John Rawls in particular than Stout lets on. Stout seems to think that if he can show that liberal democracy is itself a “thick” tradition, the new traditionalists will have to embrace it. But contra Stout, democracy is not a conceptual tradition that stands over against Aristotelianism and Augustinianism; rather, it is a form of organizing government that stands over against monarchy, oligarchy, and totalitarianism. Stout offers many helpful insights along the way, but he does not really seem to understand the nature of the religious claims of those he labels “the new traditionalists.” (c) A range of theologians and movements rejects all models of the relationship between church and state of a Constantinian variety.

But he goes further and insists that even Christians (as opposed to the church) should not make their political and cultural appeals on Christian grounds. In other words, although they should certainly be involved in doing good in and even to the city, Hart is not happy for the good that they do to be identified as a distinctively Christian product or stance. Even more suspicious of all state power is the better-known alternative represented by the many books of Stanley Hauerwas. 38 The church must be the church—apolitical body in its own right.

These and other ways of marginalizing and compartmentalizing Jesus’ lordship set up some other lord—the government, the need for retribution or nationalism—as lord over the rest of life. They are therefore idolatry. And they create secularism, because they teach that outside the private realm, or a future realm, or an ideal realm, Jesus is not relevant. Instead what are relevant are secular norms or authorities without critique from Jesus. Thus they remove just war theory from correction by gospel ethics, so that it serves some other lord and gets used dishonestly to justify wars that are not just. We argue that just war theory is not autonomous. Either it serves the purpose of reducing violence and seeking justice under Christ’s lordship, or it serves some idolatrous loyalty such as rationalizing a war that we have an urge to make.

Indeed, O’Donovan can go so far as to suggest that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution marks the symbolic end of Christendom, when it prohibits Congress from making a law to establish or hinder religion, for it frees the state from all responsibility to recognize God’s self-revelation in history. This does not mean that O’Donovan offers an aggressive defense of “Christendom.” Rather, he argues that in the wake of Jesus’ triumphant resurrection and exaltation, all the political authorities of the world have been made subject to Christ, who has triumphed over them, so that, at least in principle, they have no power left. Nevertheless, God grants them limited authority to act in this present age, before the ultimate manifestation of Christ’s kingdom.

Rather, judgment is “an act of moral discrimination that pronounces upon a preceding act or existing state of affairs to establish a new public context.” 49 So if political authorities have been set in place in the wake of Christ’s exaltation, they constitute a secondary witness to God’s own act of judgment. Using this controlling motif of judgment, much of the rest of the book works through the nature of political authority, the representation of the people, the nature of democracy, and much more. Transparently O’Donovan is in favor of fairly limited government. O’Donovan’s work has been subjected to probing scrutiny. 50 Even if one may criticize some aspects of how he arrives at the point, one of O’Donovan’s great strengths is his ability to carve out a theological grounding for the role of government without sliding into many of the traps into which so many theorists tumble.

The contrast Maritain perceives is not really between America and Europe but between America and France: when Maritain penned these lines, more than one nation in Europe still boasted a state church (e.g., England) or churches (e.g., Germany), generating patterns of relationships between church and state different both from those of America and from those of France. Clearly, Maritain is describing an America of more than half a century ago. Since then, processes of secularization and backlash have generated a rather different temper in church/state relations in the United States. Moreover, while intellectual and media elites in America adopt many of the stances of (the American version of) postmodernism, elites in France are still deeply committed to structural modernism.

Some French universities, for instance, prohibit all Christian (or other religious) gatherings on their premises. Where a similar prohibition has been attempted in the United States (sometimes on the ground that Christian groups are intolerant since they will not appoint to office those who are practicing homosexuals), Christians respond by appealing to the First Amendment and, so far at least, have prevailed in court. In France, much more authority rests with the university authorities themselves than is the case in the United States, so what is or is not permitted can appear a little more arbitrary. But the nature of the Christian appeal for use of public university premises is very different.

Becoming a Muslim, then, means coming to adopt a position and perform certain practices. This is not normally thought of as coming to know God: such talk is presumptuous, for God is so transcendent that we cannot know him directly. Becoming a Muslim means submitting to the will of God as revealed in the Qur’an, more than coming to know the God of the Qur’an.

Regeneration transforms one’s life, and the walk of faith in Jesus Christ enables us to speak of knowing God in a way quite different from our life before conversion. A child who grows up in a Christian home may well speak of the moment of his or her “conversion” at, say, age 8 or 15, or after attaining adulthood; a child growing up in a Muslim home would never speak of being converted to Islam. Islam demands conformity to the system; Christianity demands the internal transformation sometimes called regeneration.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D. A.

A church starts a center in its poor area of town to mentor kids without dads, to help kids to read, to look after some of the sick and the elderly, to start a school that has far more care, discipline, Christian influence, and rigor than in the available options, and so forth.

It rejected the older concept of “high” culture in favor of Clifford Geertz’s approach: “[T]he culture concept … denotes an historically transmitted pattern of meanings embodied in symbols, a system of inherited conceptions expressed in symbolic form by means of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about and attitudes towards life.” 1 That set the stage for surveying the very substantial number of issues Christians face when they ask questions about how they and the Christian subculture to which they belong relate to the larger culture in which they are embedded. This is something Christians face alike in southern Sudan, North Korea, Western Europe, East Asia, and everywhere else. In the English-speaking world, the controlling discussion is still that of H. Richard Niebuhr and his fivefold typology: Christ against culture, the Christ of culture, Christ above culture, Christ and culture in paradox, and Christ the transformer of culture. The second chapter offered a preliminary critique of Niebuhr. It is difficult to find any biblical warrant for the second entry in his fivefold template.

Or are they embedded in a still larger and more cohesive understanding of the relationship between Christ and culture, such that the four or five options of Niebuhr’s typology should be thought of as nothing more than possible emphases within a more comprehensive integrated whole? If the latter, then Christians do not have the right to choose one of the options in the fivefold typology as if it were the whole. The name of that game is reductionism. Much of the rest of the second chapter is devoted to another way of getting at the same question of integration. Instead of focusing on the possible ways to think about the relationship between Christ and culture, this section focuses on some of the great turning points in biblical theology, including creation, the fall, the call of Israel, the coming of Jesus Christ and the onset of an international community that is not itself a nation complete with geographical borders and a political system, and the prospect of a new heaven and a new earth and resurrection existence.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

On the whole, Niebuhr’s discussion is thin with respect to the fact that current relations between Christ and the church can be properly perceived only in the light of eternity, of a hell to be feared and a new heaven and new earth to be gained. All of these turning points must be held together all of the time as we try to think constructively and holistically about the relation between Christ and culture. Some critics, however, will object that the entire discussion up to this point is far too dependent on unsophisticated approaches to “culture” and on a barely hidden modernist epistemology. The third chapter goes some way to address both of those concerns, ending with a discussion of James K. A. Smith’s Who’s Afraid of Postmodernism? Taking Derrida, Lyotard, and Foucault to Church. 2 What, then, are some of the pressures that force thoughtful Christians to wrestle with how we ought to relate to the broader culture of which we are a part, even if we are a distinguishable part?

Inevitably Christians find themselves squeezed between the claims and obligations of the broader culture and their allegiance to Christ. The tensions between Christ and culture are both diverse and complex, but from a Christian perspective they find their origin in the stubborn refusal of human beings, made in God’s image, to acknowledge their creaturely dependence on their Maker.

Add this synthesis to the remarkable success he achieved in his lifetime, and Abraham Kuyper’s almost iconic influence is understandable. Yet once Kuyper achieved political power, his thinking underwent a subtle shift in emphasis. Eventually three major problems developed—embedded to some extent in his own thought, and occasionally notorious in the thought of his followers. (a) The antithesis between belief and unbelief, between redeeming grace and common grace, waned. A Kuyper scholar like James Bratt applauds the development; 21 with more discernment, Klaas Schilder bemoans the development. Schilder’s rather dense little book, Christ and Culture, 22 makes the point powerfully.

This is not to argue that dramatic, still less traumatic, conversion of children reared in Christian homes is necessary; nor is there a biblically mandated need for certainty about the moment of one’s conversion. Rather, it is to assert that theologically and biblically, presumptive regeneration is not well grounded, and pragmatically, it has led, in the Netherlands and South Africa (where the doctrine has most frequently been defended), to churches with very substantial numbers of unregenerate people (however culturally conservative they are) whose children then simply walk away from the faith.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Moreover, some of Niebuhr’s categories are far too antithetical. For instance: Carter follows Yoder in seeing how following Jesus entails being a part of a countercultural community. Loyalty to Jesus within this community means being opposed to the totalizing claims of the nation-state, of modernity, autonomous reason, and consumerism. This sounds a bit like Niebuhr’s “Christ against culture” option. Carter insists, however, that following Jesus does not mean that we stand against classical music, family farms, and medicine. Christ does not stand against culture in every respect. Niebuhr’s antitheses need to be moderated. In the second half of his book, Carter proposes his own typology.

There is much that is attractive in Carter’s passionate voice. What genuine Christian will not admire Carter’s desire to follow Christ wholly, to ensure that following Jesus does not degenerate into an ostensible spirituality that is abstracted from life in the here and now?

Most of them I have already addressed, in greater or lesser detail, earlier in this book, but it will not hurt to highlight three of them in summary form here. First, the dividing line in Carter’s thought is “violent coercion”—whether one thinks there is any place for it or not. Historically, this is, more or less, the adoption of pacifism as the dividing line. Even if one thinks Carter’s interpretation of the Scriptures and scriptural themes he references is correct—and rather often I do not—it is difficult to see why one should make pacifism the dividing line. He grants a subsidiary role to the Nicene Creed but manages to argue, against considerable evidence, that those who adopt any form of “violent coercion” have a flawed Christology from the perspective of Nicea, while those on the pacifist side fully embrace the Christology of Nicea. I heartily concur that there are “orthopraxy” components in authentic Christianity (though I may not always agree with Carter what they are), but surely there is more to the orthodoxy components than the Christology of Nicea. Paul, for instance, can say some pretty trenchant things about the difference between authentic Christianity and inauthentic Christianity and those who espouse either (Galatians 1:8–9), and can make the dividing line rather different from either Nicea or pacifism.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

But there is little in his argument that convincingly puts together the entire story line of the Bible, including the great turning points in redemptive history. He is tired, he avers, of the old divisions between liberalism and conservatism, both of which are dead ends, both reflecting a secularized kind of faith that is nothing less than “a heretical deviation from Christianity, and it is dying.” 38 Certainly Christianity has too often been domesticated by modernism, yet Carter, it appears, wishes to domesticate it by his post-Christian pacifist ideals. One does not sense here a careful submission to Scripture and an evenhanded learning from Christians throughout history. Rather, this is a raw championing of pacifism to which every other consideration must bend, all in the name of following Jesus.

There is little probing of “common grace” (whether it is called that or not). The commitment to pacifism, that is, his absolute rejection of “violent coercion,” leads him to devote several pages to defending the view that the Crusades and World War II are moral equivalents, both equally morally indefensible. Third, one comes away from Carter’s book without any estimate of the complexities of getting issues about Christ and culture right.

But where persecution is not complete, or comes in waves with times of relative peace between the waves, there the old saying often demonstrates its insight. The persecution tends to reduce the number of spurious converts and “Christians” who are not serious, so that when some measure of freedom, however limited, is restored, the church may grow very rapidly. Certainly in such situations Christians cannot help but see themselves as “other” than the dominant culture in many respects. When threats and brutality go on for many decades, the Christian community sometimes ends up bruised and discouraged.

In addition to close exegesis of a wide range of biblical texts, we need to think through how they fit into the great turning points of redemptive history, into the massive movement from creation to the new heaven and the new earth, with critical stops along the way for the fall, the call of Abraham, the rise and fall and rise again of Israel, the coming of the promised Messiah, his teaching, ministry, death, and resurrection, the gift of the Spirit and the birth of the church. Nor can we ignore great theological structures, including the Trinitarian nature of the Godhead, all that the cross achieves, and the unavoidable implications of New Testament eschatology with its unyielding combination of inaugurated and future eschatology. If such massive biblical and theological structures control our thinking on these matters, and such revelatory categories are worked out in our lives in adoration and action, then various ways of thinking about the relationship between Christ and Caesar may prove heuristically helpful but will not assume canonical force.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

It will embrace the exclusive claims of Christ and the uniqueness of the church as the locus of redeeming grace, and yet it will demand of believers that they recognize their creaturely existence in this old, fallen creation and reflect on the ubiquitous commands not only to love God but also to love their neighbors as themselves. Instead of imagining that Christ against culture and Christ transforming culture are two mutually exclusive stances, the rich complexity of biblical norms, worked out in the Bible’s story line, tells us that these two often operate simultaneously. As a stand-alone posture, against too often turns into brittle condemnation, a stance of haughty (presumed) moral superiority, wagons circled.

Scripture will mandate that we think holistically and subtly, wisely and penetratingly, under the Lordship of Christ—utterly dissatisfied with the anesthetic of the culture. 44 The complexity will mandate our service, without insisting that things turn out a certain way: we learn to trust and obey and leave the results to God, for we learn from both Scripture and history that sometimes faithfulness leads to awakening and reformation, sometimes to persecution and violence, and sometimes to both. Because creation gave us embodied existence, and because our ultimate hope is resurrection life in the new heaven and the new earth, we will understand that being reconciled to God and bowing to the Lordship of King Jesus cannot possibly be reduced to privatized religion or a form of ostensible spirituality abstracted from full-orbed bodily existence now.

When churches so taught thrust their members into engagement with the wider world, their members are far less likely to be snookered by the world to which they are to bear witness and in which they are to do good. We will avoid the trap aptly described by Horton: “Instead of being in the world but not of it, we easily become of the world but not in it.” 45 Instead, we will live in the tension of claiming every square inch for King Jesus, even while we know full well that the consummation is not yet, that we walk by faith and not by sight, and that the weapons with which we fight are not the weapons of the world (2 Corinthians 10:4).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.
