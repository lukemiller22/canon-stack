If there is a single word for this it is probably the word “transcendence,” or “moreness.” It defends this wordview or “big picture” mainly by contrast to its typically modern alternative, which can be called reductionism, positivism, materialism, nihilism, or naturalism as opposed to supernaturalism of any stripe, whether religious or not. Finally, it argues for this worldview not so much from its premises or origins as from its conclusions or consequences (in that sense it is an example of what William James called pragmatism), especially its consequences in life, not merely in thought (in that sense it is an example of existentialism).

They are objective truths, objective realities, that are not visible to the eye of the body but only that of the mind. But the mental eye that sees them is not merely the eye of reasoning or intelligence in the narrow modern sense, but the eye of contemplation or intellectual intuition. To call it Plato’s “Theory of Forms” is misleading for a third reason: it is not a theory first of all but an insight, a sudden, almost mystical experience. It is mystical in the sense that it’s an insight into something absolute, but it’s not mystical in the sense of irrational. In fact it’s supremely rational though not attained by reasoning. This single Big Idea that defines Platonism could be called the “theory of Big Ideas,” because the Platonic Ideas are bigger than any ideas inside of minds, and also bigger than concrete material things outside of minds.

Things are ordered because they have intelligible natures or essences. The primary question “What is it?” has real answers. Reality is intelligible to mind.

We live in the Shadowlands. (That was the title of the C. S. Lewis movie: a perfect title, because that Platonic insight was Lewis’s essential philosophy.)

There never has been a perfectly good, perfectly just state or a perfectly good, perfectly just individual, so isn’t your ideal just that, your ideal? Your personal opinion, subjective?

Values are not like rocks; we don’t discover them. They’re like art: we create them, both individually and socially, collectively, or culturally. But Plato thinks values are things like rocks. They’re objectively real. In fact, they’re harder than rocks, more real than rocks, more unchangeable, more unyielding than rocks. We don’t see them with the eyes of the body but with the eyes of the mind. But they’re not in the mind any more than rocks are in the eye.

The third is philosophical knowledge of reasons and causes by logical reasoning, getting to the kind of thing Aristotle and Plato both got to. Philosophy, like science, begins in wonder, according to the Greeks, but in science the wonder ends when the knowledge comes. The difference between science and philosophy is that it’s much harder to come to the end in philosophy. The fourth kind of knowing is the contemplation of the truth for its own sake, and the wonder that begins this is contemplative wonder. This kind of knowledge ends in wonder as well as beginning in wonder. It is a sophisticated version of the contemplative wonder of a little child. The fifth kind of knowledge is mystical.

Symbolic thinking is very close to Platonic philosophy, as C. S. Lewis explained in that long quotation in Lecture I about symbolism and allegory. When I speak of mythic thinking, I mean both the thinking that makes the myths in the first place and the thinking that hears them and enjoys them.

Each archetype is one perfect model for many imperfect imitations, or images. Both in the myths and in Plato’s philosophy the archetypes have an exalted quality, a perfection; they are paradigms, and they have an authority over human lives, which imitate them. The gods’ role as archetypes is exalted in two ways: in time and space. They are exalted in time by being put into the sacred past , when the gods were on earth or closer to the earth; and they are exalted in space by being put into the heavens, at the top of the cosmic totem pole while we mortals are somewhere near the middle. (By the way, ‘all’ premodern thinking sees the cosmos as a hierarchy.) Huston Smith, describing primitive religions, says that what is probably the most important single feature of primal spirituality is its symbolist mentality. The symbolist vision sees the things of the world as transparent to their divine source. Human ancestors are viewed as prolongations of the tribe’s earliest ancestors, who were divine.

Either He wrote the play we are in, or we are writing it; either we are only the players or also the authors. Thus the title of the old Paul Newman pro-euthanasia movie is exactly right: “Whose life is it, anyway?” That second, modern option, judged by the religious standpoint, is the basic violation of the very first commandment: “Thou shalt have no other gods before Me,” the commandment against idolatry. And the primary idolatry would be to worship ourselves. One psychologist, Paul Vitz, says America is the most polytheistic nation in history because we worship not one thousand gods or ten thousand gods but three hundred fifty million gods.

The Unknown God that some Athenians were still worshipping four hundred fifty years later, when St. Paul visited Athens, was the god Socrates worshipped, and the only one that Paul, like Socrates, approved of. In Plato’s dialog the Euthyphro , Socrates asks Euthyphro the crucial question: is a thing good merely because the gods love it, or do they love it because it is good? Euthyphro thinks the first. His gods are the willful, arbitrary, irrational tyrants of Greek mythology. Socrates thinks it’s the second option, that his god is rational and moral, and wills only good. And that is all that Socrates claims to know about him. In Socrates, the sun of reason has risen and dispelled the fogs of myth. Socrates, more than any other single person in history, invented the new way of thinking that we call reason, or rather he is the first who sharply separated and distinguished it from mythical thinking. Instead of relying on blind feelings and blind faith in the stories of Homer, which both rose from and appealed to the unconscious imagination, Socrates demanded conscious reasons, definitions, and arguments. Socrates was the first person who clearly knew what a logical argument was. A few decades later, Aristotle based the world’s first logic textbook on crates’s lived example.

The answer is by definition. A definition expresses the universal and necessary and unchangeable essence of the thing defined, unlike concrete examples which only express what is particular and accidental and changeable. For instance, you cannot define a man as a Greek, or as an adult, or as somebody who looks like Plato, even though Greeks and adults and people who look like Plato are indeed men. You must define man by omitting all the changeable and particular features and find the universal essence. Man is essentially a rational animal, a living organism with a soul capable of reason. That is his essence. A definition always seeks the essence of a thing.

This is perhaps the greatest secular speech in the history of Western civilization. It is a defense not only of Socrates but also of the life of philosophy that he is being martyred for, and a defense of the kind of human being and human life which is exemplified most perfectly by Socrates. The very last line of the Apology says that Socrates was “of all men then living, of all we ever met, the best, the wisest, and the most just.” At the heart of the Apology we find a riddling reference to an implied but not expressed definition of that Platonic Form that is in one way the primary one: the self. What is the essence of the self? “Know thyself” was the first commandment of the god of the Delphic oracle who inspired Socrates to become a philosopher. And now Socrates reveals that he has solved the oracle’s riddle. But he does this in a riddling way, indirectly, not directly. Watch how clever he is. His deepest conviction—expressed twice in the Apology with the warning words, “You will laugh and jeer at this, but please listen,” because it sounds so outrageous—is that “no evil can ever possibly happen to a good man, in this world or the next.” Socrates claims to be certain of this apparently-ridiculous thing.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 38, "processing_stage": "annotated", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T19:57:24.072867", "metadata": {"concepts": ["Self", "Wisdom", "Virtue"], "topics": ["Self/Know Thyself", "Wisdom/Philosophical Inquiry", "Virtue/Good and Evil"], "terms": ["Self/essence of self", "Self/know thyself", "Wisdom/delphic oracle", "Virtue/good man", "Virtue/no evil can happen"], "discourse_elements": ["[[Semantic/Definition]] \"What is the essence of the self?\" - the central question of Platonic Forms regarding human identity", "[[Narrative/Person]] Socrates described as \"of all men then living, of all we ever met, the best, the wisest, and the most just\"", "[[Narrative/Quotation]] \"Know thyself\" - the first commandment of the god of the Delphic oracle", "[[Logical/Paradox]] \"no evil can ever possibly happen to a good man, in this world or the next\" - Socrates' apparently ridiculous but deeply held conviction", "[[Reference/Commentary]] Analysis of Plato's 30 dialogs and their focus on Forms"], "discourse_tags": ["Logical/Paradox", "Narrative/Person", "Narrative/Quotation", "Reference/Commentary", "Semantic/Definition"], "scripture_references": [], "structure_path": "[[Lecture II: Socrates and Myth]]", "named_entities": ["Person/Plato", "Person/Socrates", "Work/Apology of Socrates", "Place/Delphic oracle", "Ideology/Platonism"]}, "annotation_method": "anthropic_claude", "annotation_model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"}

And the certainty he expresses in the Apology , that no evil can ever happen to a good man, is the most important certainty of all. It can change your life. It means that there is only one thing necessary: being good; and if you are, then no evil can ever happen to you. What justifies this conviction? It seems absurd, because evil is happening to a good man right now, even as Socrates is saying that it can’t; for he is about to be unjustly executed precisely because he is good and cannot honestly profess a faith in the wicked gods of the state.

Socrates went around trying to find a wise man by questioning supposedly wise men, so that he finally discovered what wisdom was: knowing that you had no wisdom, that only God had wisdom. This made Socrates a philosopher, in fact the first, greatest, and archetypal philosopher, the grandfather of all other philosophers, beginning with Plato.

So no evil can just happen to me. No other man can harm my soul, only my body. If he kills me unjustly, he harms only his own soul, not mine.

To use the food analogy, the dialogs are culinary adventures in cooking, not precooked TV dinners. So they are really impossible to summarize, for their logical summary is only one dimension of them.

Thus the Symposium hunts for the Form of Love. That’s why it’s probably Plato’s most popular and beautifully written dialog. The Republic is, of course, about justice, the same Form in both the individual soul and in the city-state. Book 1 of the Republic is a typical early Socratic dialog, in which Socrates, after logically refuting three wrong definitions of justice, is left with no right one and is dissatisfied because he hasn’t yet found the Form. And the practical payoff, the reason we need to find it, is because without it we can’t prove that justice is more profitable than injustice, that it alone brings happiness. That’s why the Republic is so important: it’s about the most important question in the world, the good for man, the greatest good, the meaning of life, how to live. By the end of book 1, Socrates has proved this conclusion by logical argument—that justice is always profitable—but we are not convinced, and he does not expect us to be convinced, because we did not know what we were talking about, we did not know the Form, the essence, the real nature, of Justice. It takes three hundred more pages to do that.

In that sense his Forms are not only transcendent, they are also immanent—rather like God. In his epistemology, Aristotle denies Plato’s doctrine of anamnesis , or recollection: that we have innate ideas of the Forms and need only to remember them under the prod of Socratic questioning.

Aristotle agrees that what makes us distinctively human is our rational soul, so he essentially agrees with Plato, but he adds the body too as part of our essence. He defined man as a rational animal. The practical consequences of this are clear in his Ethics. It begins by seeking the good for man, which is happiness, as Plato says, and it defines this as an active life according to virtue, as Plato also says.

{"id": "THE_PLATONIC_TRADITION___PETER_KREEFT_55", "text": "(But of course Plato did not think of the soul as a ghost any more than Aristotle did.) To see how Platonic Aristotle is, look at his epistemology. He divides knowledge into four kinds. The lowest kind is unscientific knowledge, and the three kinds of scientific knowledge are three degrees of abstraction, three degrees of universality (for like Plato, Aristotle defines scientific knowledge as knowledge of universals, which means knowledge of Forms). There are three levels of scientific knowledge for Aristotle: (1) physics, which understands universal physical laws (physical Forms) by abstracting from individual physical matter; and then (2) mathematics, which also abstracts from change and uncovers truths that are changeless, whereas physics deals with the world of time and change and motion; and finally (3) metaphysics, which abstracts from all particularity. This is really Plato’s Divided Line! Nonscientific knowledge is the lowest quarter; eikasia is his word for it: the imaginary, the knowledge of shadows. The second level is the perception of material things, which Plato called pistis (belief), because it trusts the senses.

So Plato too begins with imagination and sense perception and even mere opinion ( doxa )— the opinions of Socrates’s dialog partner. He does not omit these lower parts of knowledge but uses them as rungs on his ladder to climb above them, which is what Aristotle does too. The only important difference is Aristotle’s theory of abstraction of form from matter rather than recollection of innate ideas of the Forms. In both cases, we use logical deduction—level three of the line—to ascend to level four, which is certainty. Both believe we can attain certainty. And this, I think, is what sets them most deeply at odds with the typically modern mind. If there is one thing that will not be tolerated by moderns it is the claim to certainty. Test that claim at a fashionable cocktail party some time.

It admits no other into itself, while all other bodies give it entry.” This also explains our fascination with music: “in the realm of sound, unheard harmonies create the harmonies we hear.” And when we come to perceive the Platonic Idea of Beauty itself with the soul, Plotinus says, “we undergo a joy, a wonder, and a distress more deep than any other because here one touches truth.

Return within yourself. Truth dwells in the inward man.” And when we find truth there, the there is adverbial, not adjectival: it modifies the finding, not the truth.

All the people who have ever lived who have chosen God as the ultimate object of their love, however clearly or obscurely they have known God, are members of the City of God, and destined for eternal union with God in Heaven, since everyone eventually gets what they want, what they love. “ Amor meus pondus meum (my love is my weight, my gravity, my destiny),” Augustine says. And everyone whose ultimate love is this world and themselves, not God, will eternally get that, and not God, and they will be eternally unhappy because all human hearts are designed to be happy only by getting what they are designed to love, namely God. In other words, Augustine essentially adds three h’s to Plato: larger views of hearts, heaven, and hell. Augustine is a perfect example of the Hamlet principle: “There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, / Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.” The real thing is bigger than the biggest concept.

As our ideas are images of the things in the world, the things in the world are images of the Ideas. All concrete material beings on earth, including man, are images of the eternal archetypes, which Augustine located in the Mind of God. We can’t push this connection with Plato too far. There are at least three important differences between Plato and the Bible. First, the Bible does not teach a Platonic realm of eternal, abstract, universal essences, because the Bible is not a book of abstract philosophy.

Matter images spirit. Let’s look next at how Paul uses this same Platonic reversal. In Ephesians 3:14 he writes, “I bow my knees before the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named.” We think of “God the Father” as a metaphor or image, but Paul reverses this and says that our earthly fathers and families are metaphors or images of what fatherhood and family really is, namely God’s Fatherhood over Christ His Son and the Trinity as the Ultimate Family after whom all earthly families are named because they are created in God’s image. Jesus Himself called God his Father, and told us to call God our Father too, in giving us the Lord’s Prayer. It’s the same reversed metaphor. Earthly fatherhood is the metaphor, the image of the one perfect Platonic archetypal Fatherhood of God, in eternity over His Son and in time over us.

In us, words copy ideas and ideas copy things, but in God creating things the Ideas come first. And all these many Ideas are unified in the one Idea, or one Word, or one Divine Mind. That is the Logos which, John says, became incarnate in Jesus. So when John said that the Logos became flesh, he meant that what became the man Jesus was all three Logoi : the meaning of all things, and the wisdom that is the understanding of the meaning of all things, and the word that is the revelation of the wisdom that is the understanding of the meaning of all things.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 79, "processing_stage": "annotated", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T20:02:09.977768", "metadata": {"concepts": ["Word", "Knowledge", "Incarnation"], "topics": ["Word/Logos as Trinity of Meaning", "Knowledge/Divine Ideas vs Human Ideas", "Incarnation/Logos Made Flesh"], "terms": ["Word/logos", "Word/divine word", "Knowledge/platonic ideas", "Knowledge/divine mind", "Incarnation/word made flesh"], "discourse_elements": ["[[Semantic/Definition]] \"Logos means all three things: essence, thought, and language; or meaning, idea, and word\"", "[[Logical/Claim]] \"John is plugging Jesus into Genesis here, and the plug is Platonism\"", "[[Semantic/Relationship]] \"God's Ideas are prior to things; ours are posterior to things\"", "[[Reference/Cross-Reference]] Connection between John 1 and Genesis creation story", "[[Symbolic/Metaphor]] \"the plug is Platonism\" describing the philosophical connection"], "discourse_tags": ["Logical/Claim", "Reference/Cross-Reference", "Semantic/Definition", "Semantic/Relationship", "Symbolic/Metaphor"], "scripture_references": ["John 1"], "structure_path": "[[Lecture IV: Christian Platonism]]", "named_entities": ["Person/Jesus", "Person/John", "Person/Plato", "Person/God", "Ideology/Platonism", "Work/Genesis"]}, "annotation_method": "anthropic_claude", "annotation_model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"}

Already in the second century we find the typical pattern for the interaction between Platonic philosophy and Christianity in Justin’s autobiographical account of his philosophical and religious journey. He was a pagan Roman who came to Athens to study philosophy. Philosophy in the ancient world was not just an academic or scholarly exercise but also a very personal and life-changing thing. In fact it was more like an alternative religion, a total way of life. After all, the word “philosophy” means “the love of wisdom,” not “the game of cleverness.” Justin says the aim of the philosophers had always been “to see God.” There were five main schools of philosophy in Justin’s time: Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, Pythagoreanism, and Epicureanism, which was the only one that was atheistic and materialistic and subordinated wisdom to pleasure. Justin tried all four of the others. The Stoic philosopher he tried first disappointed Justin when he said that he neither knew God nor did he think this knowledge was necessary. Justin next went to an Aristotelian, who haggled so much over prepayment of tuition money that Justin thought “he was not a lover of wisdom but of money.” Next he tried a Pythagorean, who refused to teach Justin philosophy because he had not studied mathematics.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 81, "processing_stage": "annotated", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T20:02:25.746626", "metadata": {"concepts": ["Reason", "Knowledge", "Wisdom"], "topics": ["Reason/Philosophy vs Religion", "Knowledge/Seeking God", "Wisdom/Love of Wisdom vs Academic Exercise"], "terms": ["Reason/platonic philosophy", "Knowledge/see God", "Wisdom/love of wisdom", "Reason/philosophical schools", "Knowledge/knowledge of God"], "discourse_elements": ["[[Narrative/Person]] Justin Martyr as pagan Roman who came to Athens to study philosophy", "[[Semantic/Definition]] Philosophy as \"the love of wisdom,\" not \"the game of cleverness\"", "[[Narrative/Culture]] Philosophy in ancient world as alternative religion and total way of life", "[[Semantic/Category]] Five main schools: Platonism, Aristotelianism, Stoicism, Pythagoreanism, and Epicureanism", "[[Narrative/Event]] Justin's journey through different philosophical schools and disappointments", "[[Personal/Experience]] Justin's autobiographical account of philosophical and religious journey"], "discourse_tags": ["Narrative/Culture", "Narrative/Event", "Narrative/Person", "Personal/Experience", "Semantic/Category", "Semantic/Definition"], "scripture_references": [], "structure_path": "[[Lecture IV: Christian Platonism]]", "named_entities": ["Person/Justin Martyr", "Person/Bonaventure", "Person/Aquinas", "Place/Athens", "Ideology/Platonism", "Ideology/Aristotelianism", "Ideology/Stoicism", "Ideology/Pythagoreanism", "Ideology/Epicureanism", "Period/second century"]}, "annotation_method": "anthropic_claude", "annotation_model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"}

And how can reincarnation be a remedial punishment and an education if we don’t remember what sins we committed in our previous reincarnation? When Justin confessed that his whole purpose in studying philosophy was to see God, the old man disposed of all pagan philosophers with one question: “How should the philosophers judge truly about God when they do not know Him, since they have never seen Him or heard Him?” When Justin asked the man where he got his wisdom, he replied: Directly, from God’s prophets, who did not need or use argumentation because they were actual first-hand witnesses of God, and proved it by miracles.

Justin then argued with the other pagan philosophers as the old man had done to him, and found that this new religion, though at first accepted by faith, was also the most rational philosophy. Here, in a nutshell, is the experience not only of Justin but of nearly all classical Christian philosophers for the rest of time, and the basis of its dialog with Greek philosophy, especially Plato. There are three stages in the journey. First, Justin seeks wisdom by reason alone, and fails. Then, he accepts divinely revealed wisdom by faith. Finally, he finds that it alone satisfies his reason. He finds in the Christian religion the attainment of philosophical wisdom by non-philosophical methods. Even though Justin is relatively simple and unsophisticated, he is the paradigm case for subsequent Christian philosophers.

Bonaventure used Aristotelian terminology to make Platonic points. As a matter of fact, just about all medieval philosophers before Ockham thought of themselves as synthesizers of Plato and Aristotle, in different ways. Bonaventure relied most on Augustine, especially his doctrine of divine illumination of the intellect by the Platonic Ideas in the Mind of God. This doctrine alone, he argued, explains the presence of eternal and necessary truths in the human soul, for the soul is not eternal or necessary. We are not immutable or infallible, yet these Ideas are. Two plus two must be four, and events must have causes, and goodness must be done and evil avoided.

He sees the whole of creation as rungs on a ladder for the soul’s ascent to God. The universe is a Jacob’s ladder, a road to God, because it’s first a road down from God. The world is a great cathedral, filled with divinely painted pictures to teach us step by step our own nature and destiny. Everything on earth is an image , a resemblance, a sign, a word that expresses a meaning beyond it. Creatures are words , God’s creating was a speaking , and the universe is a book on which, he says, we read the Trinity on every page. When our eyes are opened, we see God everywhere, because He is everywhere, as an author is everywhere in his book. The four best words to summarize Bonaventure’s philosophy might be these: All things are signs. It is a very Franciscan sensibility. Think of St. Francis’s famous Canticle of the Sun, or, more properly, the Canticle of the Creatures. St. Bonaventure is St. Francis become a philosopher. Semiotics is the modern science of signs. Walker Percy, the twentieth-century Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist, found semiotics his main path out of materialism, nihilism, and atheism.

First is seeing and loving God in the vestiges He has left in matter, which are the objects of our souls’ knowing and loving—the material things in the world.

The third way is seeing and loving God finally as God Himself above our souls as the One who knows our soul which knows things, and who loves our soul, which loves things, because He knew and loved our souls into existence when He created them in His own image as knowers and lovers. Aquinas was more of an Aristotelian than Bonaventure, who totally followed Augustine’s Christian Platonism even when he used Aristotle’s vocabulary. Aquinas was more than an Augustinian, but not less. Almost never does he simply disagree with Augustine, but adds Aristotelian vegetables to the Augustinian to make an integrated Plato-Aristotle-Augustine stew. Where this is most clear and most important is in his metaphysics, especially concerning the central doctrine of all of Platonism, the theory of Ideas.

First, like Augustine, he gives Plato’s Ideas a home in the mind of God. In fact, he explicitly quotes Augustine on this, with approval. So if all red things ceased to exist, the Idea of red would still exist in the mind of God. Here, for Aquinas as well as Augustine, Plato is right and Aristotle is wrong. His second addition to Plato is that there are Ideas of individuals as well as of universals. Each person, each blade of grass, each subatomic particle, is known by God eternally, before it is created. This is really more Platonic than Platonism, not less. The second place the Platonic Ideas exist is in things, as the forms of material substances, just as Aristotle said. Aquinas adds to Platonism an Aristotelian hylomorphism (matter and form together constitute things, or “substances”, as Aristotle calls them).

So Aristotelian “abstraction” is the effect of Augustinian “illuminations. He says that the divine Mind, the Logos , is the first cause of all human intellection just as it is the first cause of the existence of material things. It illuminates us from within rather than from without, and unconsciously rather than consciously, and by nature rather than by supernatural grace; but that’s all true for Augustine too.

Everything earthly was an image of something heavenly; everything in the creation was a reflection of something in the Creator. Remember, God wrote two books, nature and scripture. Both were meant to be read, looked-along rather than just looked-at. That reading raises us above the animals. Somebody who can’t sign-read the book of nature is like a dumb dog who only looks at your finger when you point to where you want him to go instead of reading the sign and looking along your finger so as to understand your mind, your will, your intentions. Animals deal very well with matter, but they can’t understand that matter reveals spirit. That’s why God invented matter in the first place: to be an image of His spirit, His Ideas, of Platonic Ideas, of the Logos ; to make the Logos flesh in a million impersonal ways before It became flesh personally in Christ.

By saying both these things, the Platonic thing and the Aristotelian thing, Aquinas preserves both the possibility of immortality and the psychosomatic unity. Once again, it is a synthesis of Plato and Aristotle, not simply Aristotle versus Plato. Just as with the doctrine of the Platonic Ideas, Aquinas rejects not the primary Platonic point but the secondary point about its relationship to other things. Aquinas follows Aristotle in relating the soul more closely to the body than Plato did, just as he follows Aristotle in relating form more closely to matter, Ideas more closely to things, than Plato did. But even Plato had the Ideas related to things by “participation”: things “participate” in their Forms.

Nominalism is an answer to a simple question in logic: What is the reality that abstract universal terms like justice or redness or human nature refer to? Sounds like a harmless question about some very abstract idea, but (to quote the very quotable title of an old book) “ideas have consequences.” To understand the question, we have to review some basic logic. Logic is essentially the science of reasoning. Reasoning is the act of the mind by which we prove one proposition to be true (called the conclusion), by deducing it from other propositions (called premises). That’s called an argument.

There is no such thing in reality as justice or injustice, only acts that we see as resembling each other in some way so that we choose to use the same term, “just” or “unjust”, to refer to them. “Everything outside the soul is singular”—that is the formula for Ockham’s Nominalism.

Another way Ockham makes this same point is by saying that one reality can never be the basis for several concepts; every difference in concepts points to different realities. As Descartes would say two centuries later, every idea must be a clear and distinct idea. Like numbers. Thus Ockham says that the only real unity is numerical unity. Therefore there can be no such thing as the unity of the human race in common humanity. Since there is no such thing as universal human nature, there is no real universal human community. The same is true of the church or a family. They are only relationships between individuals. There is no such real thing as a community, a common unity of diverse yet unified parts, either among men or among the things in the universe. There is no such thing as cosmic order. Because there is no Logos. Platonism is dead. Next, real causality is denied. Ockham reduces causality to sensory observation that one thing regularly follows another, exactly as David Hume was to do four centuries later.

The principle is a good practical principle for judging alternative scientific hypotheses—you don’t want to bring in angels and devils to explain history, or immortal souls when you do brain chemistry—but as a principle in theoretical philosophy it means Reductionism. Deny everything you possibly can deny. Ockham applied the razor not just to the extra hair on philosophy’s beard but to its neck, its jugular vein. The Razor is his justification for Nominalism, the denial of essences, natures, species, or universals. In epistemology the consequence is the denial of abstraction. Since there are no universals there is no abstracting of them, and therefore there is no need for an active intellect to do the abstracting. The intellect is purely passive, like a blank tablet, a “tabula rasa,” simply receiving data from the senses as a blackboard receives lines from chalk. All the activity is in the chalk. In ethics, Ockham totally severs ethics from metaphysics—goodness from reality—in denying natural law. Natural law has to be universal: universal rights presuppose universal natures: we have human rights because we are all human. For Ockham, since there is no real universal human nature, morality is not based on human nature and the virtues that perfect it, but purely on our obligation to obey God’s arbitrary will, as in mainline Islamic thought.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 108, "processing_stage": "annotated", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T20:05:35.081048", "metadata": {"concepts": ["Ethics", "Knowledge", "Nature"], "topics": ["Ethics/Natural Law vs Divine Command", "Knowledge/Abstraction and Universals", "Nature/Essence and Existence"], "terms": ["Ethics/natural law", "Knowledge/nominalism", "Knowledge/tabula rasa", "Nature/universals", "Ethics/divine command theory"], "discourse_elements": ["[[Practical/Principle]] \"Ockham's Razor,\" which states that the simplest explanation is always to be preferred", "[[Logical/Claim]] The Razor is his justification for Nominalism, the denial of essences, natures, species, or universals", "[[Semantic/Definition]] The intellect is purely passive, like a blank tablet, a \"tabula rasa,\" simply receiving data from the senses", "[[Logical/Conditional]] Since there are no universals there is no abstracting of them, and therefore there is no need for an active intellect", "[[Semantic/Relationship]] Universal rights presuppose universal natures: we have human rights because we are all human"], "discourse_tags": ["Logical/Claim", "Logical/Conditional", "Practical/Principle", "Semantic/Definition", "Semantic/Relationship"], "scripture_references": [], "structure_path": "[[Lecture V: Nominalism]]", "named_entities": ["Person/Ockham", "Ideology/Nominalism", "Ideology/Reductionism"]}, "annotation_method": "anthropic_claude", "annotation_model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"}

Ockham says that if God willed us to hate Him, or to hate our fellow human being, then hate would be good and love would be evil. Ockham actually says that. This is exactly the philosophy of Islamic terrorists. Here are some of the consequences of Ockham’s Nominalism in modern philosophy. Modern philosophy really begins in the early seventeenth century with Francis Bacon’s Empiricism and Rene Descartes’ Rationalism. These are the two essential parts of the new scientific method: reducing all data to empirical data by insisting on empirical proof for every hypothesis, and reducing all reason to mathematical reason by insisting on exact mathematical measurement and the closest thing to it outside of numbers, viz. “clear and distinct ideas.” This tighter method made for great success in science.

{"id": "THE_PLATONIC_TRADITION___PETER_KREEFT_128", "text": "The essential claim of reductionism is always expressed in words like “nothing but.” or “merely” or “simply” or “just.” or “only.” X is nothing but Y. The logical problem with any kind of reductionism is that, while it seems to be skeptical and humble, it’s really the opposite: it’s really very dogmatic and arrogant. For if you claim to know that X is nothing but Y, you are saying that there is in all reality no X that is more than Y; but that means you are claiming to know all of reality. And that’s not a humble or skeptical claim at all. For instance if you claim to know that God is nothing but a myth, you are claiming to know that there is in all reality no God that is anything more than a myth, and that is claiming to know all reality.

Skinner, in the twentieth century, gave a more sophisticated version of that with his Behaviorism. Most thinkers don’t quite go so far as to reduce man to a machine, but they do reduce man to a clever animal, and reduce human reason to the operation of the computer-brain and the rationalization of animal desire.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 139, "processing_stage": "annotated", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T20:09:11.253582", "metadata": {"concepts": ["Man", "Reason", "Ethics"], "topics": ["Man/Human Nature vs Materialism", "Reason/Reductionism", "Ethics/Moral Reality vs Chemical Processes"], "terms": ["Man/anthropological reductionism", "Man/material complexity", "Reason/human knowers", "Ethics/moral goodness", "Man/clever animal"], "discourse_elements": ["[[Logical/Claim]] Man is that part of the universe that has achieved material complexity to know the whole", "[[Logical/Objection]] Materialism can't explain the difference between good and evil, between Mother Teresa and Hitler", "[[Logical/Evidence]] The difference between love and hate is not the same as presence/absence of serotonin", "[[Semantic/Definition]] Anthropological reductionism: reducing human knowers to something not qualitatively different from the universe", "[[Reference/Citation]] La Mettrie's \"Man a Machine\" and B.F.

Of course, that form of skepticism, like all forms of skepticism, is self-contradictory, for it if is true, it is not true, because if it is true, then there is no such thing as the knowledge of objective truth, only the rationalizing of subjective desire; and if there is no such thing as the knowledge of objective truth, then that idea—that there is no such thing as the knowledge of objective truth—is also not knowledge of objective truth. If all reasoning is nothing but the rationalizing of desire, then the idea that all reasoning is nothing but the rationalizing of desire is also nothing but rationalizing of desires. “Nothing-but” is always self-contradictory. Nothing-buttery always melts itself away. One of the most important aspects or subdivisions of anthropological reductionism is sexual reductionism, which began with Freud.

Freud calls even the affection of a mother for her infant “aim-inhibited affection,” and says that all affection is originally sexual. If Freud actually ever said “sometimes a cigar is just a cigar,” it’s probably only because he was in love with the words “just,” and “only,” and “nothing but.” (6) The most practical, most life-changing division of philosophy is ethics, so the most important Positivistic reductionism is in ethics. For Plato, ethics goes all the way up, so to speak, into ultimate reality, because the ultimate reality is The Good, Values are the highest kinds of facts. There is no absolute fact-value distinction. Ethics is the knowing and living of ultimate Reality. It’s not just obeying laws or satisfying conscience or doing your duty or helping others, it’s also becoming more real, more like ultimate reality, which is Absolute Goodness.

So the two main options in modern ethics both stem from the rejection of Platonism. (7) And so do the two main options in modern political philosophy—our seventh Positivism. These two options are collectivism, as in Marx, and individualism, as in John Stuart Mill’s Utilitarianism, according to which there is no common good by nature, only by convention and agreement, because there is no universal human nature. Man is not by nature a political animal in most modern political philosophers. And the reason for that is ultimately metaphysics. Modern political philosophy, like modern ethical philosophy, is skeptical of metaphysics, and thus devoid of metaphysical content.

The majority of philosophers today who call themselves “analytic philosophers” and who concentrate on logical and linguistic analysis, as the Logical Positivists did, no longer hold that extreme view.

The reason the movement died was that it is obviously self-eliminating, self-contradictory, because the Verification Principle—taken as a principle, a truth about propositions rather than merely an optional, practical method—contradicts itself. It says that all propositions that are not either tautologies or empirically verifiable are meaningless. But it itself is neither a tautology nor empirically verifiable. Therefore it is meaningless.

There is no Platonic Form, no Logos.

But this life-view has roots in a theory, a world-view, a metaphysics, as any ethical or practical philosophy always has.

Nihilism is the existential consequence of Logos lessness. To see the difference Nihilism makes, compare Shakespeare’s Macbeth with Faulkner’s classic novel The Sound and the Fury. The latter takes its title from Macbeth’s famous “Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow” speech, when he is going morally insane with despair and damnation because he and Lady Macbeth have succumbed to the temptations and deceptions of the three witches, who are from hell, not from feminist consciousness-raising circle dances. Macbeth has committed murder out of pure selfish ambition, and now he confesses that this is how life appears now to him, “full of sound and fury, sighifying nothing ”. That’s Nihilism, exactly: no significance, no signifying, no word, no message, no Logos.

It’s called damnation: a very significant evil. But from Macbeth’s point of view, life has no significance.

In Faust , Goethe told the traditional moral story of Faust, the man who sold his soul to the Devil, from an antitraditional, antimoral point of view. Traditionally, the story of Faust was like the story of Macbeth: a cautionary tale about damnation, a moral and religious lesson. Its significance, its point, was the point of the most practical sentence ever uttered, by the most practical man who ever lived; “What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?” But Goethe changed that 180 degrees. He went even farther away from the original story than Faulkner did: he sided with the devil, or the devil in Faust; Faust incorporates his own devil as well as his God, Faust accepts evil as well as good, he is told that he must become “better and more evil ,” and the true God turns out to be not the Judeo-Christian God but something like “the Force” in Star Wars : half evil and half good.", "source": "The Platonic Tradition", "author": "Peter Kreeft", "chunk_type": "text", "chunk_index": 153, "processing_stage": "annotated", "processing_timestamp": "2025-11-10T20:12:37.034770", "metadata": {"concepts": ["Soul", "Story", "Ethics"], "topics": ["Soul/Damnation and Salvation", "Story/Moral Framework", "Ethics/Good vs Evil"], "terms": ["Soul/damnation", "Soul/sold his soul", "Story/cautionary tale", "Ethics/moral lesson", "Ethics/better and more evil"], "discourse_elements": ["[[Reference/Allusion]] References to Shakespeare's Macbeth and Goethe's Faust as examples of different moral frameworks", "[[Logical/Claim]] \"A saint would also pity Macbeth, as well as fear him, and a saint would pity Vladamir and Estragon as well as laugh at them\"", "[[Reference/Citation]] \"What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and lose his own soul?\"", "[[Symbolic/Theme]] The transformation of traditional moral stories into antitraditional, antimoral perspectives"], "discourse_tags": ["Logical/Claim", "Reference/Allusion", "Reference/Citation", "Symbolic/Theme"], "scripture_references": ["Matthew 16:26"], "structure_path": "[[Lecture VII: Nihilism]]", "named_entities": ["Person/Shakespeare", "Person/Goethe", "Person/Faulkner", "Work/Macbeth", "Work/Faust", "Work/Star Wars", "Person/Vladimir", "Person/Estragon"]}, "annotation_method": "anthropic_claude", "annotation_model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514"}

All Aristotle’s logical categories apply to beings, but not to being itself, according to Heidegger. He proposed the alternative approach to being itself through an exploration of human be-ing, or human existing, which he called Dasein , being-there, and which he saw as a fundamentally different mode of being than the being of an object. Both objects and conscious subjects participate in being, but in fundamentally different ways. Man is not just the highest object, the rational animal; he is a different mode of being.

That’s the essential metaphysical meaning of Nihilism: there is no Being. You might imagine a parallel this way: man and nature have something in common if there is a single God who designed and created both, but if you subtract God the Father, man and nature are no longer brother and sister. “Being” for Sartre functions like God; since for him there is no God, there is no Being. Sartre says this atheism is the fundamental principle of his philosophy. He says: “Existentialism is nothing else than an attempt to draw all the consequences of a coherent atheist position.” Sartre’s first premise is atheism, or theological Nihilism, the nothingness of God; and here is its first consequence: it is metaphysical Nihilism, the nothingness of Being. Sartre immediately draws a second consequence, a Nihilism in anthropology: “there is no human nature, since there is no God to conceive it. Man is nothing else than what he makes of himself.” This anthropological Nihilism follows from Sartre’s metaphysical Nihilism. We have existence but no essence. Man exists, but has no meaning, no design, no Logos , since there is no God to design him. He designs himself, and nothing can justify him in designing one meaning or another.

Nietzsche made the will to power the end rather than a means, and Sartre does the same to freedom.

For those are the only two realities that have eternal and intrinsic and absolute value, and also the only two realities that none of us will ever be able to ignore or escape either in time or in eternity.

Let’s begin with the most obvious and universal crack in the cave, death. Death looks like the end: a door into darkness; yet the vast majority of all human beings who have ever lived have believed that it is a new beginning, a door into light, not darkness; up, not down. This is even true today, even in our so-called secular society, especially when people actually approach that door. We then discover our natural instinct to believe, or at least to hope. Platonism becomes very personal when we think about death. This is also true of the question of God. Death makes us ask not just “Is there a God?” but “Will I meet God?” And it is not argument but experience that will answer that question. I use the word “God” here in a broad sense, as a real being superior to us and stronger than death.

That hope strongly motivated even the agnostic Socrates. In his swan song in the Apology , he called this only a hope rather than a proof, although Plato later tried to prove it, both in the Phaedo and in the Republic. Judge for yourself how good the proofs are; I find the strongest proof in the example of Socrates rather than in the arguments of Plato. How can we know what happens at death? We know what happens to bodies at death. They do not go up but down. If they are resurrected in the end, as religious Jews, Christians, and Muslims believe, it can only be by a divine miracle, which is unprovable and unpredictable by mere philosophical reason, but only knowable by religious faith in a divinely revealed promise. But there are good arguments for the soul’s immortality, if only we have souls; for whatever souls are made of, it’s not mortal molecules. Bullets and cancer don’t kill thoughts or loves, only organs. If we’re more than apes plus computers, if we’re persons , then we can hope to live after death.

In the Symposium , Socrates says that he is willing to join the cycle of speechmaking about love, because, he says, “love is the only thing I claim to know about.” Philosophy itself is a love, the love of wisdom. A second clue is our own hearts. I think this is the single most irrefutable clue of all. Whatever else we mean by the heart—feeling, intuition, willing, choosing—we always mean the power in us that loves, that longs, that desires. Platonism appeals to the heart as well as the head, longing as well as thinking, because it tells us that our hearts’ deepest and most mysterious desire, the desire for a Good that is infinite and eternal and perfect, is a valid clue to truth, that it corresponds to reality. Thus the heart can lead the head. We can raise this from a clue to an argument. Every other innate, natural, and universal desire of our hearts matches a reality; why not this? There is no natural hunger that has no real food. If we’ve learned to trust our hearts, as we learn to trust our mothers, because they’ve delivered on every promise they’ve made to us, why should we believe that this biggest promise of all is a cheat and a lie? It’s trust, not proof, but the onus of proof is on the mistruster.

Even when all our other desires are satisfied, our heart still asks the mysterious question: “Is that all there is?” Our Eros is bigger than the sum total of its objects in this world.
