First, ever since Pentecost Christians have had to think through the nature of their relationships with others. Christians soon multiplied in number and across an amazing number of racial and social barriers, constituting a church, a fellowship, a body, that transcended the established categories of empire, ethnicity, language, and social status. Even within the pages of the New Testament, Christians are told both to view government as something ordained by God and to view at least one particular government as representative of antichrist. The earliest reported squabbles within the church turned in part on cultural differences, on perceived injustices in the distribution of services to different language groups. Beyond the pages of the New Testament, even a casual knowledge of the history of the church discloses an incredible diversity of situations in which Christians have found themselves: persecuted and reigning, isolated and dominant, ignorant and well educated, highly distinguishable from the surrounding culture and virtually indifferentiable from it, impoverished and wealthy, evangelistically zealous and evangelistically dormant, social reformers and supportive of the social status quo, hungry for heaven and hoping it won’t arrive too soon. All of these polarized possibilities reflect diverse cultural self-understanding.

My own effort in this book begins by summarizing Niebuhr, since Niebuhr has become an icon to which everyone refers, though few today still read him closely. Apart from some initial evaluation of Niebuhr on his own terms, I then try to lay out the rudiments of a responsible biblical theology that any Christian will want to acknowledge, and begin to show how these turning points in the history of redemption must shape Christian thinking about the relationships between Christ and culture (chaps. 1 and 2). The structures generated by such biblical theology are robust enough to allow the many differing emphases within Scripture to find their voices, so that to speak of different “models” of the Christ-and-culture relationship begins to look misleading. Such reflection requires more probing, not only with respect to current debates over “culture” and “postmodernism” ( chap. 3 ), but also with respect to some of the dominant cultural forces of our time ( chap. 4 ).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

The critics offer two dominant arguments. First, they insist, we simply must reject the pretension that a metanarrative is possible: there is no big explanatory story that makes sense of all the little stories. And if we reject the notion of metanarrative, we cannot continue to talk about culture, since culture is bound up with universal or even transcendental assumptions.

In short, Niebuhr wishes to be broadly comprehensive, accepting as “Christ” the various portraits of Jesus Christ found in dominant strands of Christendom. Niebuhr’s approach to what “Christ” means in his title “Christ and Culture” prompts two initial reflections. First, for him, “Christ” is not infinitely plastic. He includes no fundamentalist Arians, for instance, such as Jehovah’s Witnesses; nor does he include the Mormon Jesus. Nevertheless, the sweep of the interpretations of “Christ” that he embraces is doubtless too broad, if one is trying to limit oneself to the forms of confessional Christianity that explicitly and selfconsciously try to live under the authority of Scripture. As a result, certain elements of his understanding of the possibilities of the relationship between Christ and culture should, I think, be ruled out of court, where they are decisively shaped by a frankly sub-biblical grasp of who Christ is.

Postmoderns, especially American postmoderns, tend to give the impression that every thinker who came before them, not least those nasty moderns, were all under the delusion that genuine human knowing was absolutist. Quite frankly, this assessment of modernism is, in many cases, a caricature: modernist though he is, Niebuhr is thoroughly aware that human knowledge is partial and perspectival. Yet he wisely avoids the extreme postmodern position that concludes that knowledge of the objective is impossible. We may say some true things inadequately, even if we cannot say anything adequately, that is, with the knowledge of omniscience, with omniperspective.

The culture with which we are concerned, he says, “is not a particular phenomenon but the general one, though the general thing appears only in particular forms, and though a Christian of the West cannot think about the problem save in Western terms” (31).

Again, culture in all its forms and varieties is concerned with the “temporal and material realization of values” (36). And so, since the achievement of these values is accomplished “in transient and perishing stuff, cultural activity is almost as much concerned with the conservation of values as with their realization” (36; italics his).

This stance is found in the book of Revelation, where it is made all the more acute because Christians are threatened with persecution. But it is also forcefully depicted in 1 John. Despite its profound elaboration of “the doctrine of love” (46)—it is this Epistle which declares, “God is love” (1 John 4:8, 16)—nevertheless “the central interest of the writer … is quite as much the Lordship of Christ as the idea of love” (46). Loyalty to this Christ has entailments in the doctrinal, moral, and social realms. Moreover, “[t]he counterpart of loyalty to Christ and the brothers is the rejection of cultural society; a clear line of separation is drawn between the brotherhood of the children of God and the world” (46–48).

In the early centuries of the Christian church, they are best exemplified by the Gnostics. Although its most notable leaders were in time condemned by the church, “[t]he movement represented by Gnosticism has been one of the most powerful in Christian history.” “It sees in Christ not only a revealer of religious truth but a god, the object of religious worship; but not the Lord of all life, and not the son of the Father who is the present Creator and Governor of all things” (88–89). Although Gnosticism died out in time, 18 the “Christ of culture” position was further developed after the Constantinian settlement, in the rise of “so-called Christian civilization” (89). In the medieval period, Abélard is the best exemplar, even though his thought was far removed from Gnosticism. Formally, Abélard merely quarrels with the church’s way of stating the faith; in reality, “he reduces it to what conforms with the best in culture. It becomes a philosophic knowledge about reality, and an ethics for the improvement of life” (90).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D. A.

That is also why we are to be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority apart from what God himself has instituted (Romans 13). Synthetic answers were attempted by Justin Martyr. The first great representative of this type, however, is Tertullian’s contemporary, Clement of Alexandria. For instance, in discussing the rich, he can, on the one hand, appeal to great Stoic virtues of thankful generosity, sounding at times like the quintessential cultural Christian. But he goes farther, and gently “issues a clear Christian call to respond to the love of the self-impoverished Lord” (124). Yes, a Christian must be a good person, in accordance with the standards of “a good culture,” but Christ invites people to attain more, and gives them grace to achieve it: love of God for his own sake. “This sort of life is not of this world, and yet the hope of its realization and previsions of its reality fill present experience.” Thus Clement’s Christ “is not against culture, but uses its best products as instruments in his work of bestowing on men what they cannot achieve by their own efforts” (127).

Niebuhr seeks to demonstrate this in the way in which Thomas “sought to synthesize the ethics of culture with the ethics of the gospel” (130) and in his theory of law (135). No less importantly, “Thomas’ synthesis was not only an intellectual achievement but the philosophical and theological representation of a social unification of Christ and culture” (137). Even though that unification was promptly broken by the stresses of the fourteenth century, and further torn apart by the Reformation and the Renaissance, it marked a comprehensiveness of synthesis one is hard pressed to find again in later times. None of this should be despised: “Man’s search for unity is unconquerable, and the Christian has a special reason for seeking integrity because of his fundamental faith in the God who is One” (141). Others have of course insisted on the importance of social and civil institutions, but what “distinguishes the synthesist of Thomas’ sort is his concern to discover the bases of right in the given, created nature of man and his world” (142).

Although creation is not permitted to overpower redemption, or be overpowered by it, creation is not only the setting for redemption, but the sphere in which God’s sovereign, ordering, work operates.

(c) The conversionist adopts “a view of history that holds that to God all things are possible in a history that is fundamentally not a course of merely human events but always a dramatic interaction between God and men” (194).

Without the Logos, nothing has been created; the world that he made is his home. “John could not say more forcefully that whatever is is good.” For this evangelist, “natural birth, eating, drinking, wind, water, and bread and wine are … not only symbols to be employed in dealing with the realities of the life of the spirit but are pregnant with spiritual meaning” (197). The “world” is simultaneously “the totality of creation and especially of humanity as the object of God’s love,” it is “also used to designate mankind in so far as it rejects Christ, lives in darkness, does evil works, is ignorant of the Father, rejoices over the death of the Son” (198). But John does not provide us with any abstract doctrine of sin; rather, he illustrates it, while refusing to define it (199). Within this framework, the gift of God provided through Christ is “eternal life,” but the eschatology of the Fourth Gospel is so realized that this life is substantially enjoyed now, with all that means for all of human existence and culture. Niebuhr concedes, “We are prevented from interpreting the Fourth Gospel as a wholly conversionist document, not only by its silence on many subjects but also by the fact that its universalistic note is accompanied by a particularist tendency” (204).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

And because their love is rightly placed, all these affections of theirs are right” ( City of God xiv.9, cited on 214). Yet Augustine does not carry this conversionist program to its logical conclusion; he does not “actually look forward with hope to the realization of the great eschatological possibility, demonstrated and promised in the incarnate Christ—the redemption of the created and corrupted human world and the transformation of mankind in all its cultural activity” (215). Instead, he leaps to “the eschatological vision of a spiritual society, consisting of some elect human individuals together with angels, living in eternal parallelism with the company of the damned” (216). Niebuhr finds this step very difficult to understand, and inconsistent with what he takes to be Augustine’s dominant conversionist stance. Calvin, Niebuhr writes, is similar, making the same move as Augustine. Wesley is in the same tradition, but strengthens his conversionist heritage by becoming the exponent of perfectionism.

Thus we come to Niebuhr’s “Concluding Unscientific Postscript.” We need not follow all of his thought here; it takes us a bit far afield from his own fivefold paradigm. But it is worth picking up two points. First, Niebuhr argues that his study could be extended indefinitely, if it explored a host of other Christian leaders—not only theological thinkers, but a vast array of “political, scientific, literary and military examples of loyalty to Christ in conflict and adjustment to cultural duties.” He is thinking of “Constantine, Charlemagne, Thomas More, Oliver Cromwell and Gladstone, Pascal, Kepler, Newton, Dante, Milton, Blake and Dostoievsky [ sic ], Gustavus Adolphus, Robert E. Lee and ‘Chinese’ Gordon—these and many more.” One marvels at a few names that have been omitted, such as Abraham Kuyper, perhaps, and Abraham Lincoln, Wilberforce, and Shaftesbury. Nevertheless, Niebuhr’s point is that it is impossible to say, “This is the Christian answer” (231).

Full-blown Gnosticism is a second-century development. It is parasitic on first-century theology, rather than coeval with it. Many have responded to Bauer’s book with detailed and penetrating criticism. 3 For instance, noting that Bauer’s title claims to address what takes place in “earliest Christianity,” even though he examines only the second century, I. Howard Marshall opts for the cheeky title, “Orthodoxy and Heresy in Earlier Christianity.” 4 The point to recall is that the New Testament writers themselves distinguish between orthodoxy and heresy, both in early writings (e.g., Galatians 1:8–9; 2 Corinthians 11:3–4) and later writings (e.g., 1 John). And when Gnosticism did develop and grow strong, its theological emphases, though they were in line with a lot of contemporary thought in the broader culture, were far removed from central biblical “givens.” In short, Gnosticism has neither the credentials nor the profile to warrant inclusion in a book of this sort (unless, of course, one is also willing to include Arians, Nestorians, Mormons, and so forth). Similarly for liberal theology, which is one form of what Niebuhr calls “culture Christianity”: transparently, Niebuhr is not talking about what C. S.

And both will be left on the ash pit of history. To digress for a moment, this observation, though defensible, doubtless cries out for more nuance. As Henri Blocher has pointed out, there yet remain many flourishing liberal congregations. 9 More importantly, Blocher points out, when publishers, not least in Europe, seek authors to write manuals of religion or introductions to religious ethics, they almost always approach those in the liberal tradition. Certainly the faculties of theology and religion in universities find their loyalties in that same tradition. Worse, at least one wing of evangelicalism is constantly tempted in this direction.

So Niebuhr’s claim is true, at least at some superficial level. Yet it is misleading: in Niebuhr, the metaphorical use of elements in nature is then quietly linked to realized eschatology, so utterly realized that what Niebuhr wants, in the ideal, is such a transformationist approach to culture that everything gradually gets better by the grace of the gospel. True, John’s Gospel is eschatologically more realized than some other New Testament documents, but his ultimate hope is not in the progressive transformation of the world but in the final cataclysm: Jesus is going away to prepare a place so that his followers may join him (John 14), and when he returns the Son of Man will open the graves of all, precipitating a resurrection to life and a resurrection to condemnation (John 5:28–29).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

It follows that the first sin is a failure to love God with heart and soul and mind and strength. It is the sin that is always committed when any other sin is committed. The second commandment is to love one’s neighbor as oneself. It is only the second, because what makes sin most heinous in the first place is its offensiveness to God: he is always the most offended party. Moreover, the second commandment is grounded in the first. The words that Jesus quotes from Leviticus 19:18 make this clear: “Love your neighbor as yourself. I am the Lord. ” Experience confirms the witness of Scripture: we cannot long sin against God without sinning against God’s image-bearers, and if in measure we do love God, we will love those who bear his image (an insight that 1 John repeatedly substantiates).

Scan the entire Old Testament: What is it that characteristically evokes God’s wrath? It is, quite simply, idolatry—all that degrades God or diminishes God or de-gods God or replaces God. And since God is the sovereign Judge, human beings must finally be reconciled to him or be lost. The New Testament Scriptures place similar emphasis on the wrath of God, and insist that the only thing that spares us from destruction under this wrath is the death of God’s own Son. “‘He himself bore our sins’ in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness” (1 Peter 2:24). The alternatives are absolute: “Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God’s wrath remains on them” (John 3:36). The wretched fact is that we were by nature deserving of wrath (Ephesians 2:3). This wrath is described as “blazing fire,” when Jesus himself “will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord” (2 Thessalonians 1:7–9). Because of the things that constitute us idolaters, “God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient” (Ephesians 5:6).

As the Bible’s story line unfolds, sin’s wretched dimensions become clearer and clearer. Sin can be seen not only as idolatry and as the archetypal hubris, but also as the transgression of law that God lays down. It weaves its own web of corruption and its entailments, as God gives his creatures over to their own desires. Sin is social: although it is first and foremost defiance of God, there is no sin that does not touch the lives of others. Even secret sins of the heart and mind adversely affect others, since by subtly changing me, they change my relations with others. Secretly nurtured lust, for instance, soon affects a man’s or a woman’s relations with the spouse and with other human beings. That is one reason why God’s judgment is poured out on people to the third and fourth generations of those who hate God (Exodus 20:5): sin is social. Judgment comes not only in the death of every generation, but in the sweeping condemnation of the flood (Genesis 7–8), in the repeated cycles of war, pestilence, and famine (e.g., Judges, the exile), and ultimately in hell itself, about which Jesus says so much.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

When Jesus inaugurates the long-awaited and long-predicted kingdom, “kingdom” carries diverse weight, depending on the context—or, as the specialists put it, “kingdom” becomes a tensive symbol that is decisively shaped by the surrounding contexts. Often “the kingdom of God” is best thought of as “the reign of God,” for “kingdom” is far more commonly dynamic than static, rather more “kingdominion” or “reign” than “kingdom.” In the New Testament, the kingdom comes with the baby who is born a king (Matthew 2). It also comes with the onset of Jesus’ public ministry and the announcement of the dawning of the kingdom. It is displayed in the miracles and preaching of Jesus’ disciples (Luke 10:1–24). In Jesus’ parables, it can embrace good and evil, encompassing God’s providential sovereignty, extending so far that it is the context in which both the wheat and the weeds grow (Mark 4); alternatively, it is highly restricted and becomes that subset of God’s dynamic reign under which there is eternal life (John 3:3, 5).", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

That is the direction in which the plotline moves. To interpret them without primary reference to the cross and resurrection is simply irresponsible. Moreover, within the much larger framework of the canon, Jesus’ death is tightly bound up with his “fulfillment” of the Old Testament sacrifices (especially those of Passover and Yom Kip-pur), and his resurrection vindicates him. Jesus himself understands his death to provide a ransom for many (Mark 10:45; Matthew 20:28); his words of institution at the last supper demonstrate that he understands his death, the shedding of his blood and the breaking of his body, to be the ground of the remission of sins, as well as the inauguration of the new covenant. Small wonder that the apostle Paul insists his practice is to focus his preaching on the cross (1 Corinthians 2:1–5), which he understands as God’s design to cancel sin and absorb the wrath, in the person of God’s Son, that should have come to us (Romans 3:21–26). In similar vein, the apostle Peter sees in the cross both the model of self-sacrificing service to others, and the unique sacrifice in which Christ bore our sins in his own body on the cross(1Peter 2:24).It takes an effort of will to hear the power of such claims today, because the phrases are so well known that they trip off our tongues and dance through our memories.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

The context is important. As a trap, some Pharisees and Herodians, in a strange mixing of bedfellows, ask Jesus whether or not it is lawful to pay the imperial tax to Caesar. If he replies in the affirmative, he risks alienating many in his Jewish audience, not only because they detested the Roman superpower, but also because the Emperor, whose image was on the coin, was worshiped as in some sense divine. If the coin by which this tax was paid was the denarius, it would have borne the head of Tiberius, the reigning Caesar, along with the words, in Latin, “Tiberius Augustus Caesar, Son of the Divine Augustus” (TI CAESAR DIVI AVG F AVGVSTVS). To approve payment of such a tax, to such a lord, in such a medium, seemed tantamount to idolatry. On the other hand, if Jesus replies in the negative, he can be charged, by the Romans themselves, with inciting insurrection. Jesus responds by asking for the relevant coin to be brought to him. He holds it up and asks the question, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” Inevitably, they respond with “Caesar’s.” That is when Jesus utters his famous dictum: “Give back to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” At one level, then, Jesus’ reply was a brilliant maneuver by which he evaded the trap and left his opponents speechless.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

The first will be most clearly perceived when we recall that up to that point in history, religion and state were everywhere intertwined. This was true, of course, of ancient Israel: at least in theory, Israel was (as we have seen) a theocracy. Similarly in the pagan world: most of the gods of the people were necessarily the gods of the state. When the Romans took over some new territory, they arranged a god-swap: they adopted some of the local gods into their own pantheon and insisted that the locals take on some of the Roman gods. This had the effect of breaking down local allegiance to gods that were peculiarly theirs. If rebellion erupted, it would be less than clear on whose side the various gods were fighting. But nowhere was there a state that was divorced from all gods, what we would call a secular state, with state and religion occupying distinct, even if overlapping, spheres. But on the face of it, that is what Jesus is advocating.

Moreover, this way of looking at things is one of the most important features that differentiates Christianity and Islam. Islam has no body of tradition that enables it to distinguish between church and state. Indeed, the ummah, the people themselves, bound up with allegiance to Allah, are, in theory at least, more important than any state. But the state’s role, finally, is to bow to the law of Allah. Yet we must not think that Jesus’ utterance warrants an absolute dichotomy between God and Caesar, or between church and state, or between Christ and culture. That brings up the second detail in the text that must be observed. When Jesus asks the question, “Whose image is this? And whose inscription?” biblically informed people will remember that all human beings have been made in the image and likeness of God (Genesis 1:26). Moreover, his people have the “inscription” of God’s law written on them (cf. Exodus 13:9; Proverbs 7:3; Isaiah 44:5; Jeremiah 31:33).

Certainly we must do so if that pattern depends on abandoning so many biblical “givens.” Nevertheless, a highly modified form of this “Christ of culture” pattern can be construed, one that does not abandon the elements of biblical theology. In his mercy, God leaves traces of himself and his ways in every culture. That is the point of some popular missiological accounts, such as Don Richardson’s well-known Peace Child: 31 there are elements in any culture to which the gospel may legitimately appeal, even if (and here we leave Niebuhr behind) the adoption of the gospel will inevitably transform that culture in important ways. (2) An analogy may help clarify this first point. Some theologians have identified different “models” of atonement theory that have been constructed across the history of the church, and have sought to ground each within the New Testament: the moral governance theory, for instance, or the substitutionary atonement theory, and so on. But this is methodologically flawed. When some historical figures have sought to propound one “model” of the atonement at the expense of another, as we earlier witnessed with Abélard, there has usually been a larger theological agenda operating.

A person learns, say, English, and thus is said to be an English speaker (langue), but the English he or she speaks is not English in the abstract, or the totality of all that goes by “English.” The language spoken by an individual may be said to be English (langue), but what is actually spoken is the performance of that individual (parole).

Of course, one finds similar diversity among Calvinistic views of culture. One thinks, for instance, of the sharp differences between Abraham Kuyper and Klaas Schilder. 19 But common to the thought of all of these thinkers is the view that the Lordship of Christ over all of culture demands that Christians, even while they pursue evangelism and disciple-making, must earnestly seek to establish Christ’s claims within the broader culture in which they live, not by withdrawing and setting up counter-models, but by engaging and transforming the culture. I shall return to these questions in the last two chapters. Three kinds of issues must be addressed here; the broader challenge of postmodernism I will take up again in a few pages. First, that stance is most likely to be deeply Christian which attempts to integrate all the major biblically determined turning points in the history of redemption: creation, fall, the call of Abraham, the exodus and the giving of the law, the rise of the monarchy and the rise of the prophets, the exile, the incarnation, the ministry and death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the onset of the kingdom of God, the coming of the Spirit and the consequent ongoing eschatological tension between the “already” and the “not yet,” the return of Christ and the prospect of a new heaven and a new earth.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

But it is easy to see how downplaying these turning points can introduce other massive distortions into one’s understanding of cultures and therefore of how to interact with them. For example, if creation is ignored, it becomes easy to develop a quasi-gnostic view of salvation and much more difficult to grasp that human responsibility is fundamentally grounded in the fact that we owe everything to our Creator. What is lost is a sense of indebtedness. Equally sad, people might be tempted to a purely non-corporeal vision of “salvation,” with devilish consequences in the physical world. Or again, if the fall is minimized, including the way that it is developed across the canon, sin is diminished. Worse, the fundamental nature of idolatry—the de-godding of God, the desperate failure to love God with heart and soul and mind and strength—fades into a ghostly image of itself, and this in turn dissolves one of the most central and controlling aspects of salvation described in the Bible, namely, being reconciled to God on God’s terms.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Failure to integrate, say, the exodus and the giving of the law robs us of the great Old Testament paradigm of liberation, of God-revealed norms, of a notion of holiness tied simultaneously to God and to the maintenance of what God has prescribed and proscribed, of the tension between being saved from something and being saved for something, of a people peculiarly belonging to God, of an entire covenantal structure that turns on a tabernacle/temple, a priesthood, a sacrificial system—all of which are taken up and modified in various ways in the New Testament.

This springs in part from the fact that in France, postmodernism was tightly connected with certain literary and critical readings of texts, which readings are no longer in vogue, but never gained control of the philosophical schools: the analytic tradition of philosophy, regnant in much of Europe, never succumbed to postmodernism’s reductionisms. Further, the influence of François Lyotard, who taught his readers to be deeply suspicious of all “big pictures” or “metanarratives,” made it inconsistent to speak of postmodern ism, any more than of any other “ism.” A very recent French work, written by an able philosopher, can speak of “postmodernity ” as a phenomenon, 27 but certainly not of “postmodern ism. ” By contrast, postmodernism in America has become a sloganeering word that touches almost every human domain. Still, it must be said that some strands of European thought are profoundly anti-metaphysical—a stance that, in America, would be labeled postmodern, even if the label does not quite work in France.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Religion in general and Christianity in particular, they say, is moving to the place where it must abandon “onto-theology,” “realism,” and “objectivism,” and as a result it is losing any capacity it once had to order the public square. Its function is merely to provide private comfort, and in that capacity it performs a civic duty, it displays civic virtue. The authors disagree on how Christianity arrived at this point—Rorty thinks Christianity is capsizing owing to progressive En lightenment pressure, while Vattimo thinks that the change springs from Christianity’s own message: the “actual message” of Christianity has nothing to do with metaphysics but only with love under stood in ways congruent with postmodern nihilism—but they agree on the central thesis.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

If things are not the way they’re supposed to be, why not?), the question of salvation (What is the problem, and how is it resolved?), the question of telos (Why am I here? What does the future hold?). It does not purport to identify all the subatomic quarks; it does not claim to say all that might be said about God. It merely claims to cast a broad enough vision to be able to see the shape of the whole.

Such reflection belongs to another project. Nevertheless it must be said that a Christian worldview, a Christian theological vision, is more than a system of beliefs (though it is never less): it also includes the volition that self-consciously thinks and acts in line with such beliefs. The biblical story line, which finally centers on the gospel of Jesus Christ, establishes the summum bonum, the highest good, the thing we actively cherish and pursue. That is why John can speak both of believing the truth and of doing it. But to argue, with Raschke, that in this postmodern age we need to go “beyond” worldviews into a stance in which we admit God is so Wholly Other that we can receive him only by faith, and that this response is entirely in line with the Reformation’s insistence on sola fide, 53 is confused at several levels. In particular, once again it has distorted “worldview” into something unrecognizable by any side in the discussion. After all, the attempt to take the Bible’s story line seriously leaves plenty of space for what is unknown about God: modernists, too, read Deuteronomy 29:29 (“The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever”), the end of Romans 11 (“Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of God!", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Still more importantly, faith, according to the Bible, is often nurtured and strengthened precisely by the bold articulation and defense of the truth. Trust in God, fostered and nurtured by the power of the Spirit, is grounded not so much in what is unknown about him but in what he has disclosed of himself—not only in supernatural acts, the chief of which is the resurrection of Jesus, but in words of promise and instruction, which are to be believed and acted upon. Raschke’s view of faith has more in common with Bultmannian existentialism 54 than with the Reformation, let alone with the New Testament. Perhaps this is the place to point out that the postmodern penchant for affirming the unknowability or the incomprehensibility of God, often with pious reference to Calvin’s affirmation of the doctrine, habitually overlooks some fundamental distinctions. In particular, there is an enormous chasm between what Calvin means by “God is incomprehensible” and what Kant means by “God is incomprehensible.” For Calvin, God extends immeasurably beyond what human beings may know, but that does not mean that human beings may not know any true things about him, the more so since this God has graciously chosen to reveal to his image bearers some true things about himself.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

Moreover, even though we regularly speak of God in analogical language, some elementary distinctions steer us around some avoidable pitfalls. 56 One can say true things by means of a metaphor. 57 Further, if Scripture necessarily deploys analogy to refer to much of what God has disclosed of himself in Scripture, it is useful to distinguish between univocal analogy and equivocal analogy. Thus a statement such as “God exists” is not, for Christians, a metaphorical statement (i.e., it is not a product of human creativity), but a univocal analogical assertion: the spiritual being “God” can be said to “exist” in many of the same ways that we say that we ourselves “exist.” The statement “God is our heavenly Father” is, by contrast, an equivocal analogical statement: that is, although God is not univocally what we mean by “father,” yet mutatis mutandis (“equivocally”) God is the “heavenly Father” to those who are his children.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

These grand narratives are meant to be legitimating; they constitute the basis on which other knowledge claims are built. Nevertheless, Lyotard contends, these grand stories have no independent status; they are themselves the product of certain people and cultures. “Lyotard very specifically defines metanarratives as universal discourses of legitimation that mask their own particularity; that is, metanarratives deny their narrative ground even as they proceed on it as a basis…[T]he problem with metanarratives is that they do not own up to their own mythic ground. Postmodernism is not incredulity toward narrative or myth; on the contrary, it unveils that all knowledge is grounded in such” (69). Postmodernism wishes to overthrow the universalizing pretensions of modernism. All of this, Smith contends, is a very good thing for the gospel. It is reminiscent of Francis Schaeffer and Cornelius Van Til. Lyotard was not trying to overturn Christianity; he was trying to overturn modernism, and Christians should be grateful for his effort.

We must see the evils that Foucault sees—Smith himself primarily applies Foucault to capitalism—and yet reject Foucault’s warnings against all forms of “disciplinary society.” Rather, precisely because God does exercise authority, God’s people must form disciplinary societies that are able to stand up and pull away from the seductive and destructive attractions of, say, MTV. Certainly the need for godly discipline, empowered by the Spirit of God, is very great. But of course, Foucault himself makes no exceptions for God. Elsewhere Foucault explicitly ties everything that he finds wrong with the exercise of power to what he understands of Christian institutions. In other words, despite the fact that Smith wants postmodern Christians to learn something valuable from Foucault, even he has to admit that Christians must go directly counter to Foucault when it comes to Christian discipline and the exercise of power intrinsic to it.

When Luke introduces his Gospel, hetells Theophilus that he is writing “that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught ” (Luke 1:4, emphasis added). After his resurrection, Jesus “presented himself to [his disciples] and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive” (Acts 1:3). Of course, many biblical writers also stress the crucial importance of faith. My point is that they can talk about faith and truth, about believing and knowing. Clearly this knowing is not the knowledge of omniscience; the “certainty” that Luke wants Theophilus to enjoy is not the certainty that belongs to God alone. But this is the language of Scripture, and it is entirely appropriate to the modes and extent of knowing of which human beings are capable. (4) That brings us to Augustine, “I believe, therefore I understand.” Since Smith does not tell us what he thinks the noun “faith” or the verb “to believe” mean, I am not quite certain that I have understood him aright. But in common with other theologians in the Radical Orthodoxy movement, I think he has slightly skewed the meaning of these words from the semantic range found in the New Testament and in Augustine.

In Hebrews, faith includes the element of perseverance (see how strong that element is in Hebrews 11, for instance). But without exception, faith is invalidated if its object is untrustworthy, or, where ostensible facts are concerned, if the object of faith is not true. The Bible never encourages us to put our faith in what may or may not be true. (d) It follows that if we believe something that is not true, “we are to be pitied more than all others” (15:19). In other words, Paul does not think faith is virtuous because those who exercise the faith are sincere or devout. Faith without a true object, Paul asserts, is pitiful. In much of the Western world, however, faith is not at all tied to the truthfulness or reliability of its object. Faith is little more than personal, subjective, religious preference.

I suppose we might say that there are ambiguous elements in faith in that we trust God and his Word even where we cannot clearly see the way ahead. But the point to observe is that in the Bible it is right to trust this God with the future, not because of what we do not see or know, but because of what we have come to know of this God—including such truth as the fact that God raised his own dear Son from the dead for our justification. Faith enables us to have confidence in God where we do not see, because it is grounded in the immutable character of God that we have come by grace to perceive as utterly reliable. Smith does not work this out, for he is too busy trying to distinguish faith from knowing, introducing a polarity utterly unknown in Scripture. When Augustine writes, “I believe, therefore I understand,” he thinks of faith in a biblical sense, not in Smith’s slightly woolly sense, still less in the street sense of much Western subjectivism.

In a word, democracy is messy. Many serious commentators have noted that to have a reasonably stable democracy in the Western sense, various conditions must prevail. At the very least, there must be an independent judiciary, a free press, some system of equality before the law (usually with an enshrined constitution and a disciplined police force), structures to ensure that the military is under civilian control, and a system of changing who is in charge without bloodshed (usually a stable two-party or multi-party system).

Ideally, it will be the first step toward something more substantial, 21 but an illiberal democracy may pass a vote, even a reasonably clean vote, merely to justify a tyrant, a butcher, or an ideologue (religious or otherwise).

She wants a form of liberalism, she says, in which liberals do not defend mere atomistic individualism but understand full well that individuals usually flourish in the context of private associations, “identity groups” (hence the title of her book), including churches. Moreover, liberals should not merely put up with these identity groups in some concessive fashion: they must heartily endorse freedom of association. So far so good. But Gutmann treats all associations—churches, drama groups, NAACP, even groups identified by such words as “geek, jock, bimbo, and hottie,” as nothing more than the result of individual choices. These identity groups are fluid and changing, little more than the contexts of individual freedom of choice. Thus the primacy of individual freedom of choice is front-loaded into the discussion.

If gays insist on their right to membership in the Boy Scouts, or feminists insist that they have equal rights of participation in the leadership of Orthodox Jewish life, then government has both the right and the obligation to force these groups to comply. If many members of these groups feel that their rights and freedoms are thereby being trampled into the mud of the liberal-egalitarian vision, that’s their problem: their views cannot be allowed to supersede “democratic justice” and “civic equality.” It is deeply troubling to discover that Gutmann does not even see the problem.

Moreover, not every minister of the gospel is hungry for power in some improper sense. The example of Christ is a constant constraint on those with sensitive consciences: the Master was the perfect suffering Servant, but he was also the one who cleared the temple precincts by overturning the tables of the money changers and driving out their animals with a whip. As Richard John Neuhaus never tires of telling us, one does not have to choose between being a thug or a wimp. However falteringly, we try to learn when it is right to suffer abuse and love those who persecute us, very much like the Master himself, and when it is right to clear the temple, very much like the Master himself.

The doctrine of God reminds us that we are not ultimate: God is. The doctrine of creation tells us we are not our own: we are responsible to the One who made us. Any “power” we exercise is derived, and we will be held accountable for what we do with it. The doctrine of sin will challenge us not to indulge in the creative stances that endlessly excuse our idolatry. The entire plotline of the Bible tells us, again and again, “Be reconciled to God.” The death of Christ removes the huge load of guilt we otherwise bear, while his resurrection enables us to anticipate the new heaven and the new earth, the home of righteousness—even while his example calls us to renounce self-promotion, for we are called to suffer with him and only then to reign with him.

The list of troubling expressions includes “religion,” “church,” “state,” “nation,” “faith,” “society,” and several others I have already probed somewhat in this book, including the words “faith” and “culture.” So a little unpacking seems to be in order.

This assumption arises most clearly in Christianity and in substance in the Judaism out of which Christianity sprang. But such a quest was very much at odds with surrounding “religions” in the first century, which focused on sacred rites and cultic observance, on preservation and conservation of ancient traditions. The influence of Christianity and the rise of multiculturalism have together encouraged other “religions” to become quests.

Even matters of justice within the congregation were in some measure handed over to other spirit-filled men (6:1–7). When the distinctive duties of pastors/elders/bishops are canvassed, the priority of the ministry of the Word and prayer is paramount. These ministers preach and teach and evangelize (the ministry of the Word extends beyond preaching). It is within the church that people are baptized and come together around the Lord’s Table.

Add to this a shame culture, and treason seems horribly vile. Again, in the heyday of the British Empire, it was particularly reprehensible to act in a way that would knowingly harm the Empire. By contrast, where a state delights in its rollicking diversity, treason itself becomes democratized. 8 There is no “big idea” by which everything must be tested. In America, prosecutors may zealously go after those who have engaged in treason, but the media are never outraged. Rather, they are intrigued, sometimes even vaguely admiring. (2) The Roman Empire of the first century certainly falls into the “empire” category of Werner’s analysis, but it was nevertheless characterized by a number of polarities that are relevant to our discussion.

But the literary markers to which Hurley appeals are far from convincing.

If the state in this instance is not the active agent of persecution, neither is it the bulwark of religious freedom. In some instances we simply do not know enough about the first-century dynamics to detect where, in opposing religious dangers, the political dangers might lie.

Such accommodation God reprobates in the strongest terms: the exalted Christ says to those who have stood firm against such idolatry, “But you have this in your favor: You hate the practices of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate ” (2:6). The strength of such opposition between faithful Christians and the Nicolaitans might have had political ramifications, if the Nicolaitans had the ear of the authorities, but in this case we do not have enough evidence to make a determination. Of course, Luke carefully records events that turn out another way—when local authority actually restrains mob violence. The city clerk in Ephesus rebukes the mob because he does not want uproar to attract imperial attention and jeopardize the relative independence of the city’s government (Acts 19:35–41).

Congress was not to meddle in such matters, which had the effect of leaving an established church in some states, and leaving other states without an established church, as the states themselves preferred.

But whatever Jefferson meant, the First Amendment was increasingly seen through the grid of that phrase. It entered the vocabulary of the Supreme Court in 1878 (Reynolds v.

Christians and non-Christians alike can make use of the goods in this autonomous secular realm, even if they do so with a “different faith” and “different hope.” In fairness to Markus, it is important to observe how carefully he distinguishes this secular sphere from contemporary secular liberalism. Augustine’s secular sphere, Markus argues, unlike secular liberalism, is devoid of moral categories. It is bound up only with meeting material needs, with establishing order and security. The very recent work by Kristen Deede Johnson 33 appeals to Augustine in a slightly different way. The heritage of liberal democracy has taught people to rank tolerance among the highest of the virtues, while what she calls “post-Nietzschean celebration of difference” 34 sets such a premium on difference that the result is incompatible with liberal democracy.

Yet the thrust of the book is more sympathetic to liberal democracy (which pretty soon becomes, in Stout’s usage, indistinguishable from liberal secularism) in general and to John Rawls in particular than Stout lets on. Stout seems to think that if he can show that liberal democracy is itself a “thick” tradition, the new traditionalists will have to embrace it. But contra Stout, democracy is not a conceptual tradition that stands over against Aristotelianism and Augustinianism; rather, it is a form of organizing government that stands over against monarchy, oligarchy, and totalitarianism. Stout offers many helpful insights along the way, but he does not really seem to understand the nature of the religious claims of those he labels “the new traditionalists.” (c) A range of theologians and movements rejects all models of the relationship between church and state of a Constantinian variety.

But he goes further and insists that even Christians (as opposed to the church) should not make their political and cultural appeals on Christian grounds. In other words, although they should certainly be involved in doing good in and even to the city, Hart is not happy for the good that they do to be identified as a distinctively Christian product or stance.

Indeed, O’Donovan can go so far as to suggest that the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution marks the symbolic end of Christendom, when it prohibits Congress from making a law to establish or hinder religion, for it frees the state from all responsibility to recognize God’s self-revelation in history. This does not mean that O’Donovan offers an aggressive defense of “Christendom.” Rather, he argues that in the wake of Jesus’ triumphant resurrection and exaltation, all the political authorities of the world have been made subject to Christ, who has triumphed over them, so that, at least in principle, they have no power left.

Rather, judgment is “an act of moral discrimination that pronounces upon a preceding act or existing state of affairs to establish a new public context.” 49 So if political authorities have been set in place in the wake of Christ’s exaltation, they constitute a secondary witness to God’s own act of judgment.

If we must have conservative Christians in the country, they had better learn that religion is a purely private matter. In other words, Jefferson’s wall of separation lies between the state and all outward expressions of religion that have any bearing on anything in which the state may have a vested interest, not between the state and the church as church. In short, these writers think that the only way the wall of separation can be maintained is by making religion, especially Christianity, as private as possible. Some of these writers feel so much under threat that they think legislation should be passed to ban Christians from public office. How they think the “free exercise” phrase is strengthened by this approach is hard to imagine. In the name of freedom they deeply wish to curtail the freedoms of those who may disagree with them. As America becomes more polarized, issues of the relationship between church and state become more heated and more threatening than ever before.

Inevitably these variations change the relationships between church and state. The American Revolution and the French Revolution were not far apart in history, but in some ways they headed in opposite directions. In substantial measure, the origin of the U.S. Constitution (including the Bill of Rights) aimed to protect (the Christian) religion from the state; the French Revolution was much more interested in protecting the state from religion. In its wake, the value of la laïcité (which variously means something of a cross between laicization and secularization) was unquestioned—and still is. Comparison of the trajectories from the American and the French revolutions has often been attempted. Results have been mixed. It is worth reporting two of them here.

The contrast Maritain perceives is not really between America and Europe but between America and France: when Maritain penned these lines, more than one nation in Europe still boasted a state church (e.g., England) or churches (e.g., Germany), generating patterns of relationships between church and state different both from those of America and from those of France. Clearly, Maritain is describing an America of more than half a century ago. Since then, processes of secularization and backlash have generated a rather different temper in church/state relations in the United States. Moreover, while intellectual and media elites in America adopt many of the stances of (the American version of) postmodernism, elites in France are still deeply committed to structural modernism.

Some French universities, for instance, prohibit all Christian (or other religious) gatherings on their premises. Where a similar prohibition has been attempted in the United States (sometimes on the ground that Christian groups are intolerant since they will not appoint to office those who are practicing homosexuals), Christians respond by appealing to the First Amendment and, so far at least, have prevailed in court. In France, much more authority rests with the university authorities themselves than is the case in the United States, so what is or is not permitted can appear a little more arbitrary. But the nature of the Christian appeal for use of public university premises is very different.

Then we will be damned not only for our views but also for our dissembling.

Five further layers of subtlety call for attention.

Moreover, the fivefold typology is not very effective at interacting with current discussions over postmodernism. And now we find it lacking in an age when notions like “the Christian west” cannot really be sustained, when multicultural-ism has shaped many decisions of the Supreme Court, and when immigration patterns force us to think about the way non-Christian religions, notably Islam, are likely to view the typologies Niebuhr proposes.

{"id": "CHRIST_AND_CULTURE_REVISITED_347", "text": "Part of the reason lies with the imperialist expectations of Islam, but part lies in quite a different understanding of “conversion” as compared with the notion of conversion espoused by Christians. To become a Muslim, one need only confess that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is his messenger. One is supposed to commit oneself to the five fundamental practices of Islam, but plenty of nominal Muslims don’t bother. Becoming a Muslim, then, means coming to adopt a position and perform certain practices. This is not normally thought of as coming to know God: such talk is presumptuous, for God is so transcendent that we cannot know him directly. Becoming a Muslim means submitting to the will of God as revealed in the Qur’an, more than coming to know the God of the Qur’an. By contrast, Christian conversion, though it includes changing an allegiance and adopting some practices, is understood to be connected with the work of the Spirit of God in one’s life. Regeneration transforms one’s life, and the walk of faith in Jesus Christ enables us to speak of knowing God in a way quite different from our life before conversion. A child who grows up in a Christian home may well speak of the moment of his or her “conversion” at, say, age 8 or 15, or after attaining adulthood; a child growing up in a Muslim home would never speak of being converted to Islam.

Or are they embedded in a still larger and more cohesive understanding of the relationship between Christ and culture, such that the four or five options of Niebuhr’s typology should be thought of as nothing more than possible emphases within a more comprehensive integrated whole?

Much of the rest of the second chapter is devoted to another way of getting at the same question of integration. Instead of focusing on the possible ways to think about the relationship between Christ and culture, this section focuses on some of the great turning points in biblical theology, including creation, the fall, the call of Israel, the coming of Jesus Christ and the onset of an international community that is not itself a nation complete with geographical borders and a political system, and the prospect of a new heaven and a new earth and resurrection existence.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

On the whole, Niebuhr’s discussion is thin with respect to the fact that current relations between Christ and the church can be properly perceived only in the light of eternity, of a hell to be feared and a new heaven and new earth to be gained. All of these turning points must be held together all of the time as we try to think constructively and holistically about the relation between Christ and culture. Some critics, however, will object that the entire discussion up to this point is far too dependent on unsophisticated approaches to “culture” and on a barely hidden modernist epistemology.

Inevitably Christians find themselves squeezed between the claims and obligations of the broader culture and their allegiance to Christ. The tensions between Christ and culture are both diverse and complex, but from a Christian perspective they find their origin in the stubborn refusal of human beings, made in God’s image, to acknowledge their creaturely dependence on their Maker. The fifth chapter focuses on one particular element of the relationship between Christ and culture, namely, church and state. The aim of the chapter is to clarify a few of the terms and issues that surround the subject, survey some of the relevant biblical passages, and show how the sometimes competing claims of church and state have evolved in different places. Although there are better and worse examples of how these tensions might play out, there is no ideal stable paradigm that can be transported to other times and places: every culture is perpetually in flux, ensuring that no political structure is a permanent “solution” to the tension.

Because all truth is God’s truth, because nothing we legitimately study is unrelated to Christ, Kuyper felt compelled to demonstrate how Christ’s sovereignty operates in every sphere.

Niebuhr’s typology is possible only on the assumption of the fundamental legitimacy of the Constantinian settlement. 36 Substantial chunks of it have to change once we perceive “why Christendom was a bad idea.” 37 Weigh in the massive decline of Christian influence in most of those parts of the world once thought of as constituting Christendom, and the urgency of the need to rethink Niebuhr becomes transparent. Moreover, some of Niebuhr’s categories are far too antithetical. For instance: Carter follows Yoder in seeing how following Jesus entails being a part of a countercultural community. Loyalty to Jesus within this community means being opposed to the totalizing claims of the nation-state, of modernity, autonomous reason, and consumerism. This sounds a bit like Niebuhr’s “Christ against culture” option. Carter insists, however, that following Jesus does not mean that we stand against classical music, family farms, and medicine. Christ does not stand against culture in every respect. Niebuhr’s antitheses need to be moderated. In the second half of his book, Carter proposes his own typology. He makes a fundamental divide between, on the one hand, three Christendom types and, on the other, three non-Christendom types. All three of the Christendom types accept violent coercion.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D. A.

There is much that is attractive in Carter’s passionate voice. What genuine Christian will not admire Carter’s desire to follow Christ wholly, to ensure that following Jesus does not degenerate into an ostensible spirituality that is abstracted from life in the here and now?

We can understand why, as Mouw puts it, Schilder’s critique of Kuyper can be thought of as “the Anabaptist corrective.” Moreover, at the level of concrete decisions regarding how Christians should be concerned for the poor, for instance, or should stand against the great god consumerism, Carter has many useful things to say, and on such matters he and his followers will surely join hands with many Christians in other traditions.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

{"id": "CHRIST_AND_CULTURE_REVISITED_379", "text": "Yet however acute his criticism of Niebuhr, and however thought-provoking his own schema, Carter’s thesis raises problems that will not go away. Most of them I have already addressed, in greater or lesser detail, earlier in this book, but it will not hurt to highlight three of them in summary form here. First, the dividing line in Carter’s thought is “violent coercion”—whether one thinks there is any place for it or not. Historically, this is, more or less, the adoption of pacifism as the dividing line. Even if one thinks Carter’s interpretation of the Scriptures and scriptural themes he references is correct—and rather often I do not—it is difficult to see why one should make pacifism the dividing line. He grants a subsidiary role to the Nicene Creed but manages to argue, against considerable evidence, that those who adopt any form of “violent coercion” have a flawed Christology from the perspective of Nicea, while those on the pacifist side fully embrace the Christology of Nicea. I heartily concur that there are “orthopraxy” components in authentic Christianity (though I may not always agree with Carter what they are), but surely there is more to the orthodoxy components than the Christology of Nicea. Paul, for instance, can say some pretty trenchant things about the difference between authentic Christianity and inauthentic Christianity and those who espouse either (Galatians 1:8–9), and can make the dividing line rather different from either Nicea or pacifism.", "source": "Christ and Culture Revisited", "author": "D.

But there is little in his argument that convincingly puts together the entire story line of the Bible, including the great turning points in redemptive history.

There is little probing of “common grace” (whether it is called that or not).

The persecution tends to reduce the number of spurious converts and “Christians” who are not serious, so that when some measure of freedom, however limited, is restored, the church may grow very rapidly. Certainly in such situations Christians cannot help but see themselves as “other” than the dominant culture in many respects.

One sees this world as a wasteland of godlessness, with which the Christian should have as little as possible to do. The other regards cultural transformation as virtually identical to “kingdom activity.” 42 One of the important points of this book is that both of these options, and a lot of others as well, are, in the light of Scripture, painfully reductionistic. With appropriate caveats, it is easy to find some biblical warrant for both of these songs, and for a few others with apparently competing messages as well. That, however, is simply another way of saying that each is built on too selective a reading of biblical themes. Sociologists will develop their own grids for analyzing complex movements, of course, and find ways to categorize diverging Christian responses to the broader culture. The descriptive power of such grids may be insightful in various ways, and of course they can also be challenged on assorted grounds.
