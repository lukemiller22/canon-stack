For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord; he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.\nLet the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.

Let no one say when he is tempted, \"I am being tempted by God,\" for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.\nDo not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
