    - Chunk:: I fled Him, down the nights and down the days;
      I fled Him, down the arches of the years;
      I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways
         Of my own mind; and in the mist of tears
      I hid from Him, and under running laughter.
                  Up vistaed hopes I sped;
                  And shot, precipitated,
      Adown Titanic glooms of chasmèd fears,
         From those strong Feet that followed, followed after.
                  But with unhurrying chase,
                  And unperturbèd pace,
              Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,
                  They beat -- and a Voice beat
                  More instant than the Feet
              "All things betray thee, who betrayest Me."

    - Chunk::             I pleaded, outlaw-wise,
      By many a hearted casement, curtained red,
          Trellised with intertwining charities;
      (For, though I knew His love Who followèd,
                  Yet was I sore adread
      Lest, having Him, I must have naught beside.)
      But, if one little casement parted wide,
          The gust of His approach would clash it to:
          Fear wist not to evade, as Love wist to pursue.
      Across the margent of the world I fled,
          And troubled the gold gateways of the stars,
          Smiting for shelter on their clangèd bars;
                  Fretted to dulcet jars
      And silvern chatter the pale ports o' the moon.
      I said to Dawn: Be sudden -- to Eve: Be soon;
          With thy young skiey blossoms heap me over
                  From this tremendous Lover --
      Float thy vague veil about me, lest He see!
         I tempted all His servitors, but to find
      My own betrayal in their constancy,
      In faith to Him their fickleness to me,
          Their traitorous trueness, and their loyal deceit.
      To all swift things for swiftness did I sue;
          Clung to the whistling mane of every wind.
                But whether they swept, smoothly fleet,
              The long savannahs of the blue;
                  Or whether, Thunder-driven,
                They clanged his chariot 'thwart a heaven,
      Plashy with flying lightnings round the spurn o' their feet: --
          Fear wist not to evade as Love wist to pursue.
                  Still with unhurrying chase,
                  And unperturbèd pace,
              Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,
                  Came on the following Feet,
                  And a Voice above their beat --
              "Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me."

    - Chunk:: I sought no more that after which I strayed
                  In face of man or maid;
      But still within the little children's eyes
                  Seems something, something that replies,
      They at least are for me, surely for me!
      I turned me to them very wistfully;
      But just as their young eyes grew sudden fair
                  With dawning answers there,
      Their angel plucked them from me by the hair.
      "Come then, ye other children, Nature's -- share
      With me" (said I) "your delicate fellowship;
                  Let me greet you lip to lip,
                  Let me twine with you caresses,
                      Wantoning
                  With our Lady-Mother's vagrant tresses,
                      Banqueting
                  With her in her wind-walled palace,
                  Underneath her azured daïs,
                  Quaffing, as your taintless way is,
                      From a chalice
      Lucent-weeping out of the dayspring."
                      So it was done:
      I in their delicate fellowship was one --
      Drew the bolt of Nature's secrecies.
                  I knew all the swift importings
                  On the wilful face of skies;
                  I knew how the clouds arise
                  Spumèd of the wild sea-snortings;
                      All that's born or dies
                  Rose and drooped with; made them shapers
      Of mine own moods, or wailful or divine;
                  With them joyed and was bereaven.
                  I was heavy with the even,
                  When she lit her glimmering tapers
                  Round the day's dead sanctities.
                  I laughed in the morning's eyes.

    - Chunk:: I triumphed and I saddened with all weather,
                  Heaven and I wept together,
      And its sweet tears were salt with mortal mine;
      Against the red throb of its sunset-heart
                  I laid my own to beat,
                  And share commingling heat;
      But not by that, by that, was eased my human smart.
      In vain my tears were wet on Heaven's grey cheek.
      For ah! we know not what each other says,
                  These things and I; in sound I speak --
      Their sound is but their stir, they speak by silences.
      Nature, poor stepdame, cannot slake my drouth;
                  Let her, if she would owe me,
      Drop yon blue bosom-veil of sky, and show me
                  The breasts o' her tenderness:
      Never did any milk of hers once bless
                      My thirsting mouth.
                      Nigh and nigh draws the chase,

                      And past those noisèd Feet
                      A voice comes yet more fleet --

      My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.
      My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,
      Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.

      I swung the earth a trinket at my wrist,
      Are yielding; cords of all too weak account
      For earth with heavy griefs so overplussed.
